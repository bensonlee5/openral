  S1 Vision-Language-Action policy. Capabilities: pick, place, pick_and_place on pen. SmolVLA finetuned for pen pick-and-place on a real SO-101 follower arm (Apache-2.0).

# smolvla-so101-pen — rSkill discovery view

> **Generated view, not a hand-written skill.** This `SKILL.md` is a discovery-only
> mirror of [`rskill.yaml`](./rskill.yaml), produced by `tools/generate_rskill_skillmd.py`.
> It lets tools that read the standard agent-skill format find and reason about this
> OpenRAL rSkill. The `rskill.yaml` manifest is the single source of truth
> (CLAUDE.md §1.3). Do not edit by hand — edit the manifest and regenerate.

## What it is

An OpenRAL **Vision-Language-Action policy** (`role: s1`, `kind: vla`). SmolVLA finetuned for pen pick-and-place on a real SO-101 follower arm (Apache-2.0). Emits 6-DoF absolute joint-position chunks (size 50, in joint degrees) from two RGB views (side/overview + wrist). Wrapped for local debugging of the `openral deploy run` real-hardware path; the upstream repo went gated after this host cached the snapshot — deploy with HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1.

## Capabilities

- **Verbs:** pick · place · pick_and_place
- **Objects:** pen
- **Scenes:** tabletop
- **Embodiments:** so101_follower

## Why this is discovery-only

An agent skill is natural-language instructions loaded into an LLM's context. An rSkill
is an executable artifact: it carries a typed capability/embodiment contract, model weights,
a runtime, and a license/provenance gate — none of which fit in freeform markdown. So an
agent can use this view to *select* the right skill, but cannot *execute* it by loading
this file. Execution always goes through the OpenRAL loader and the robot HAL.

## License

- **Code:** Apache-2.0.
- **Weights:** `apache-2.0` — permissive / commercial-use OK

## How to actually run it (not via an agent harness)

```python
from openral_rskill import rSkill

skill = rSkill.from_pretrained("OpenRAL/rskill-smolvla-so101-pen")
# the loader validates embodiment / sensors / runtime / quantization against the target
# RobotDescription and enforces the weight-license gate before any weights load.
```

See [`rskill.yaml`](./rskill.yaml) for the authoritative, validated manifest.
