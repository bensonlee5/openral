# rskill-verify-outcome

A `kind: playbook` rSkill: a symbolic S2 **decision procedure** the
Reasoner reads, not a neural policy. It carries no weights — the authored
[`PLAYBOOK.md`](./PLAYBOOK.md) *is* its runtime.

## What this skill does

Closes the loop after a skill or subtask completes (Inner Monologue). The action
result ("the policy reported done") is not the same as the world state, so this
playbook **verifies** what actually happened: it asks the scene a specific yes/no
success question, cross-checks a reward monitor, optionally confirms the object's
pose, and **classifies success or failure with evidence** before the reasoner
proceeds. A failure routes to a replan or human handoff — never a silent
"success". Concrete walkthrough: the black-bowl-on-plate example in
[`PLAYBOOK.md`](./PLAYBOOK.md).

## How it works

This playbook is **content, not code**. When installed, the reasoner injects
`PLAYBOOK.md` into its system prompt and follows the SOP, composing tools it
already has (`query_scene`, `query_task_progress`, `locate_in_view`,
`memory_write`, `emit_prompt`). It is `role: s2` and is **never** dispatched
through `ExecuteSkill`. Any motion a downstream replan triggers is an
`execute_rskill` → Action chunk → C++ safety kernel — the playbook holds no
actuation authority (CLAUDE.md §1.1).

### Observation → action contract

None. A playbook emits no `Action` chunks and requires no actuators
(`actuators_required: []`, `chunk_size: 1`). Its "output" is the sequence of
tool calls the reasoner makes while following the SOP, bounded by
`playbook.max_steps`.

## How it was authored / Upstream provenance

N/A — a playbook is **hand-authored**, not trained: it has no weights and no
upstream model. Its provenance is the authoring decision record
(also linked via `paper_url`). To change behaviour, edit `PLAYBOOK.md` and bump
`version`.

## Supported robots

Embodiment-agnostic — declares the explicit wildcard `embodiment_tags: ["any"]`
(never an empty list). Gated by `capabilities_required`
(`has_vision: true` — a real `RobotCapabilities` flag): the loader filters it out
on robots without a camera. The scene / reward queries are gated at runtime by
the composed tools, not by this playbook's flags.

## Sensors required

None directly. The tools it composes declare their own sensor needs.

## Manifest summary

- `kind: playbook`, `role: s2`, `actions: [plan]`, `chunk_size: 1`.
- `playbook.trigger`: a skill or subtask has just completed and its success is not directly observable from the action result.
- `playbook.done_predicate`: the outcome is classified success or failure with evidence, and a failure has triggered a replan or handoff.
- `playbook.max_steps`: 6.

## Quick start

```python
from openral_core.schemas import RSkillManifest

m = RSkillManifest.from_yaml("rskills/verify-outcome/rskill.yaml")
assert m.kind == "playbook" and m.playbook is not None
print(m.playbook.trigger)
```

## Reproduction

Packaging-only: the manifest + SOP are validated by
`tests/unit/test_playbook_rskill_manifest.py`. There is no benchmark number to
reproduce; the playbook's behaviour is exercised by the reasoner integration
tests in later phases.

## Evaluation

N/A — no `eval/*.json`; a playbook produces no benchmarkable policy output.
