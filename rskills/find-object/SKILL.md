  S2 decision-procedure playbook (weightless). Capabilities: plan on open-vocabulary object. S2 decision procedure: locate a named object, falling back to bounded commonsense active search and finally human handoff. Composes recall_object, resolve_place, locate_in_view and NAVIGATE/OPEN skills. Discovery view of an OpenRAL rSkill — NOT directly runnable by an agent harness; it runs via rSkill.from_pretrained + the robot HAL.

# find-object — rSkill discovery view

> **Generated view, not a hand-written skill.** This `SKILL.md` is a discovery-only
> mirror of [`rskill.yaml`](./rskill.yaml), produced by `tools/generate_rskill_skillmd.py`.
> It lets tools that read the standard agent-skill format find and reason about this
> OpenRAL rSkill. The `rskill.yaml` manifest is the single source of truth
> (CLAUDE.md §1.3). Do not edit by hand — edit the manifest and regenerate.

## What it is

An OpenRAL **decision-procedure playbook (weightless)** (`role: s2`, `kind: playbook`). S2 decision procedure: locate a named object, falling back to bounded commonsense active search and finally human handoff. Composes recall_object, resolve_place, locate_in_view and NAVIGATE/OPEN skills.

## Capabilities

- **Verbs:** plan
- **Objects:** open-vocabulary object
- **Scenes:** kitchen · indoor
- **Embodiments:** any

## Why this is discovery-only

An agent skill is natural-language instructions loaded into an LLM's context. An rSkill
is an executable artifact: it carries a typed capability/embodiment contract
a runtime, and a license/provenance gate — none of which fit in freeform markdown. So an
agent can use this view to *select* the right skill, but cannot *execute* it by loading
this file. Execution always goes through the OpenRAL loader and the robot HAL.

## License

- **Code:** Apache-2.0. This is a weightless rSkill (the manifest *is* the artifact).

## How to actually run it (not via an agent harness)

```python
from openral_rskill import rSkill

skill = rSkill.from_pretrained("OpenRAL/rskill-find-object")
# the loader validates embodiment / sensors / runtime / quantization against the target
# RobotDescription and enforces the weight-license gate before any weights load.
```

See [`rskill.yaml`](./rskill.yaml) for the authoritative, validated manifest.
