# OpenRAL deploy-image entrypoint — probes for ROS 2 and the local
# colcon `install/` overlay, sources whichever it finds, then exec's
# the user command.
#
# Probe-style (rather than hardcoded `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash`)
# so the same script survives future Dockerfiles that ship a different
# ROS distro (Humble on L4T 22.04, none on a minimal variant, etc.) —
# none of those exist today, but adding the dispatch up-front beats
# re-implementing the lookup in every per-arch image. From a later
# amendment, "Single-Dockerfile consolidation + CUDA-13/DeepStream-9
# alignment".
#
# The local `/workspace/install/setup.bash` overlay is the colcon
# install tree baked into the image by the builder stage — it carries
# openral_msgs (IDL), every openral_* lifecycle node, and the C++
# safety_kernel binary. Sourcing it AFTER the system ROS distro keeps
# the ament search path correct (system first, overlay second).
