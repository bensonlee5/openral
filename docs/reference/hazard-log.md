## Entry 001 — `try_shutdown` sweep for e-stop/watchdog nodes (issue #290)

**Date:** 2026-06-12
**PR:** #290 (try_shutdown sweep — 4 safety-path nodes)
**Files changed:**
- `packages/openral_safety/openral_safety/supervisor_node.py`
- `packages/openral_human_estop/openral_human_estop/forwarder_node.py`
- `packages/openral_safety_watchdog/openral_safety_watchdog/deadman_watchdog_node.py`
- `packages/openral_safety_watchdog/openral_safety_watchdog/hardware_estop_node.py`

### What changed

All four `main()` entry points replaced bare `rclpy.shutdown()` with
`rclpy.try_shutdown()` (idempotent — no-op when the context is already shut
down) and added `except (KeyboardInterrupt, ExternalShutdownException): pass`
around `rclpy.spin(node)`.

### Hazard analysis

**No change to enforcement behaviour.** This PR modifies only the process
teardown path — the `main()` function that starts and stops the node process.
It does not modify:

- Any envelope check, threshold, or limit.
- Any topic publish/subscribe surface.
- Any estop firing logic (`_handle_violation`, `_fire_estop`, `_on_human_estop`).
- Any deadman deadline or watchdog arming/disarming logic.
- Any service callback (`/openral/estop_reset`).
- The C++ safety kernel (`cpp/openral_safety_kernel/`).

**Before:** `rclpy.shutdown()` in the `finally` block crashed with
`RCLError: rcl_shutdown already called on the given context` on every
operator Ctrl-C (SIGINT), because rclpy's SIGINT handler already shut the
context down before the `finally` ran. This replaced `KeyboardInterrupt`
with a confusing `RCLError` traceback and stalled the launch supervisor's
wait-for-children past the 30 s `shutdown_grace` window.

**After:** `rclpy.try_shutdown()` is idempotent (no-op if already shut down).
The `except (KeyboardInterrupt, ExternalShutdownException): pass` is scoped
exclusively to normal-teardown signals — it does NOT catch `Exception`,
`ROSError`, or `ROSSafetyViolation`. An E-stop condition or safety-path
failure that propagates up to `main()` is still not silently swallowed.

**Cannot leave motors energised:** These are process entry-points, not
actuation control loops. By the time `main()` is exiting:
- The safety supervisor has already published on `/openral/estop` for any
  in-flight violation (the `_handle_violation` path is unaffected).
- The deadman watchdog has already fired its estop via `_fire_estop`.
- The hardware estop node has already published on SIGINT-triggered edge.
- The C++ safety kernel (ADR-0020) owns the actuation gate independently and
  is not affected by Python process teardown.

**Conservatism:** The new behaviour is strictly at least as conservative as
the old: the enforcement path is byte-identical; only the teardown-failure
mode is repaired.

### Tests (structural regression guards)

Four AST-structural guards added — one per node:
- `packages/openral_safety/test/test_supervisor_node_sigint_shape.py`
- `packages/openral_human_estop/test/test_forwarder_node_sigint_shape.py`
- `packages/openral_safety_watchdog/test/test_deadman_watchdog_node_sigint_shape.py`
- `packages/openral_safety_watchdog/test/test_hardware_estop_node_sigint_shape.py`

Each asserts: (a) `try_shutdown` is used and bare `rclpy.shutdown()` is NOT
present in `main`, (b) the spin is wrapped catching exactly
`(KeyboardInterrupt, ExternalShutdownException)`, (c) the except does NOT
catch `Exception`/`ROSError`/`ROSSafetyViolation` (the "does not mask E-stop"
proof).

### Safety-WG reviewer gate

**This PR still requires explicit sign-off from a safety-WG reviewer before
merge**, per CLAUDE.md §3. The hazard analysis above and the structural test
suite are the author's contribution; the reviewer must independently verify
the no-enforcement-change claim.

## Entry 002 — Standardized description assets: relocate lowering inputs (ADR-0058)

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**ADR:** [ADR-0058](../adr/0058-standardized-description-assets.md) (standardized
robot description assets — URDF / xacro / MJCF / SRDF)
**PR:** _pending_ (implementing PR for ADR-0058; this entry is authored with the
ADR per CLAUDE.md §3 and links the regression test below as its mitigation)
**Files to change (safety-relevant subset):**
- `packages/openral_safety/openral_safety/urdf_lowering.py` — delete the
  divergent `_load_urdf_model`; route URDF/SRDF reads through the new
  `openral_core.assets.resolve_asset` resolver.
- `python/core/src/openral_core/assets.py` — new single resolver (the file
  locator the lowering tool now calls).
- The 16 `robots/<id>/robot.yaml` manifests — migrated to the `assets:` block;
  `ur5e`/`ur10e`/`rizon4`/`openarm` gain vendored `robots/<id>/<id>.urdf`.

### What changed

This change replaces four divergent asset-resolution mechanisms (two of them
URDF loaders) with **one** resolver, `resolve_asset(ref, kind)`, and folds the
asset references into a structured `RobotDescription.assets` block. For the
xacro-only robots (`ur5e`/`ur10e`/`rizon4`) and `openarm`, the lowering tool now
reads a **vendored, pre-expanded URDF** instead of expanding upstream xacro
in-process.

It changes **only how the source URDF/SRDF/MJCF files are located** — not their
contents, not the lowering algorithm, not the ACM sampling seed.

### Hazard analysis

**The C++ safety kernel does not read URDF/SRDF/MJCF at runtime.** It reads only
the lowered `collision_geometry` + `allowed_collision_pairs` from the manifest
(`collision_params_from_description`). URDF/SRDF/MJCF are *inputs to the offline
lowering tool* (ADR-0030), which produces those lowered fields at authoring time.

This PR does **not** modify:

- Any kernel check, threshold, capsule-distance test, or ACM lookup.
- The lowering geometry algorithm (mesh→capsule fit, primitive bounds).
- The ACM derivation or its deterministic sampling seed
  (`_RNG_SEED = 20260610`, `_N_SAMPLES = 2000`).
- The committed `collision_geometry` / `allowed_collision_pairs` values in any
  manifest.

**Same input bytes → same lowered output.** The upstream URDF/SRDF/MJCF reach the
lowering tool unchanged; the vendored URDFs are the *expanded* form of the same
upstream xacro the divergent loader expanded before. Therefore the lowered
geometry and ACM are byte-identical.

**Conservatism:** identical geometry and an identical ACM are, by construction,
at least as conservative as what they replace (CLAUDE.md §3). The change cannot
make any pair newly *allowed* (less safe) without changing the ACM bytes — which
the regression test forbids.

**Cannot leave motors energised:** no actuation path, no E-stop logic, and no
process-teardown path is touched; this is an authoring-time file-locator change.

### Mitigation — byte-identical lowering regression test (release blocker)

For every robot carrying `collision_geometry` in its manifest, re-run lowering
through the new resolver and assert the output is **identical** to the committed
values: byte-for-byte for the ACM pairs, geometric equality for the capsules.
**A diff blocks the release.** This is the primary mitigation. It is backed by
the unchanged existing safety suite:
`packages/openral_safety/test/test_urdf_lowering_fk.py` (incl.
`test_franka_acm_uses_srdf_when_srdf_path_set`), the `mjcf_lowering` tests, the
envelope-loader tests, the kernel integration tests, and the fleet guard
`tests/unit/test_collision_lowering_fleet.py`.

### Safety-WG reviewer gate

**This change requires explicit sign-off from a safety-WG reviewer before
merge**, per CLAUDE.md §3. The reviewer must independently verify (a) the
"kernel never reads these files / this only relocates them" claim and (b) the
byte-identical regression evidence across the fleet, including that the vendored
`ur5e`/`ur10e`/`rizon4`/`openarm` URDFs lower to the same geometry the in-process
xacro path produced.

## Entry 003 — MJCF collision lowering assigns `dof_index` by joint order (issue #77)

**Date:** 2026-06-21
**PR:** chore/safety_kernel_improvements (issue #77 — finish the safety kernel)
**Files changed:**
- `packages/openral_safety/openral_safety/mjcf_lowering.py`

### What changed

`lower_collision_params` lowers a compiled `mujoco.MjModel` to the kernel's
collision ROS parameters. Each movable (hinge/slide) link needs a `dof_index` —
the column of the commanded joint vector (`ActionChunk.flat`, the actuated qpos
order) that drives that link — so the kernel's allocation-free forward
kinematics can place the link at the *commanded* configuration. `dof_index = -1`
marks an immovable joint: FK never reads its angle and freezes the link at its
rest transform.

**Before:** the lowering built its dof lookup keyed by the *manifest* joint
names (`{name: i for i, name in enumerate(joint_names)}`) but resolved it with
the *MJCF's own* joint names. Real robots name their MJCF joints differently
from the manifest (`panda_joint1` vs `joint1`; `shoulder_pan` vs `Rotation`),
so every lookup missed and **every `dof_index` collapsed to `-1`**.

**After:** the i-th movable MJCF joint (in body order) is assigned manifest
column `i`, capped at `len(joint_names)` (a joint past the commanded vector — a
robot's second, mimic, gripper finger — maps to `-1` rather than out of bounds).
This follows the normative convention that `RobotDescription.joints` enumerates
joints in the same order as the robot's MuJoCo actuators
(`python/hal/src/openral_hal/_mujoco_arm.py` docstring), i.e. the same order the
HAL already uses to dispatch actions. Joint *names* are no longer consulted.

### Hazard analysis

**This is a latent-failure repair, and is strictly more conservative.**

The pre-fix behaviour was a **silent no-op**: with `dof_index` all `-1`, the
kernel FK'd the whole arm at its rest pose regardless of the commanded chunk, so
the geometric self/world/voxel collision check could *never* reject a colliding
configuration. `openral deploy sim` *prefers* the MJCF-lowered model
(`sim_e2e.launch.py`), so for every MJCF robot whose joint names differ from its
manifest (franka, so100, so101 — verified; UR-series coincidentally matched and
were unaffected) the kernel logged "self-collision check enabled" while
providing **no geometric protection at all**. Surfaced by a live
`openral deploy sim --config scenes/deploy/libero_pnp.yaml` run (kernel log:
`ADR-0040 … fk_dofs=0`).

**Conservatism argument:** the change moves the geometric check from "never
fires" (a no-op) to "fires on a real overlap". It cannot make the kernel *less*
safe:
- It adds no path that *passes* a chunk the old code would have *rejected*. The
  old code's geometric stage rejected nothing (frozen FK ⇒ a fixed rest pose
  that the in-tree manifests are authored collision-free), so every newly
  computed verdict is either an unchanged pass or a *new* rejection.
- The scalar envelope checks (n_dof / position / velocity / torque / workspace /
  EE-speed) are untouched — they already enforced independently of `dof_index`.
- A *wrong* mapping could only cause a **false-positive** estop on a valid
  motion (fail-safe: the kernel drops + latches; the operator clears via
  `/openral/estop_reset`). It cannot wave through a real collision the scalar
  checks miss, because the geometric stage only ever *adds* rejections.
- Verified live that the corrected mapping does **not** false-positive at rest:
  the real franka and so100 MJCF-lowered models pass their rest configuration
  through the real kernel (`dof_index` now `[-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,-1,7,-1]` and
  `[-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]` respectively).

**Cannot leave motors energised:** no actuation path, no E-stop firing logic,
and no process-teardown path is touched. This is a configuration-lowering
(build/launch-time) change; the kernel's hot path and latch logic are unchanged.

### Mitigation — tests (regression + end-to-end enforcement)

- `tests/sim/safety/test_mjcf_lowering_dof_index.py` — unit: an MJCF whose joint
  names do not match the manifest still lowers to ordered `dof_index`
  (`[0, 1]`), a joint past the commanded count maps to `-1`, and a welded link
  consumes no column. **These fail on the pre-fix code** (all `-1`).
- `tests/sim/safety/test_kernel_mjcf_lowered_self_collision.py` — end-to-end
  through the **real** `safety_kernel_node`: a 3-link MJCF with mismatched joint
  names returns *different* verdicts for straight (`q=[0,0,0]` pass), bent-clear
  (`q=[0,2.4,0]` pass) and folded (`q=[0,π,0]` → `KIND_COLLISION`, link1↔link3).
  A differential verdict is only possible when the FK tracks the commanded
  joints — the decisive proof the no-op is repaired.
- The existing `tests/sim/safety/test_mjcf_lowering_mesh_only.py` (mesh-only
  sentinel) still passes unchanged.

### Safety-WG reviewer gate

**This change requires explicit sign-off from a safety-WG reviewer before
merge**, per CLAUDE.md §3. The reviewer must independently verify (a) the
"strictly more conservative — only adds rejections" argument and (b) that the
ordinal mapping matches the actuator/qpos order the HAL dispatches for every
in-tree MJCF robot (no off-by-one against `RobotDescription.joints`).

## Entry 004 — so100_follower manifest collision model self-collides at home (`base`↔`upper_arm`)

**Date:** 2026-06-22
**PR:** _this PR_ (docs-only finding; no safety code or geometry change — see "Decision" below)
**Files changed:** `docs/reference/hazard-log.md` (this entry only). **No change to**
`packages/openral_safety/`, `cpp/openral_safety_kernel/`, or any
`robots/*/robot.yaml` collision block.

### What was found

Driving the **real C++ `safety_kernel_node`** with the so100_follower manifest
collision model (`openral_safety.envelope_loader.collision_params_from_description`
on `robots/so100_follower/robot.yaml`) and `self_collision_enabled=True`, a
`JOINT_POSITION` chunk is **dropped + E-stopped** as `KIND_COLLISION` self
`base`↔`upper_arm` across the robot's entire near-home region:

| config                                   | kernel result          | `min_distance_m` |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| zero `q=[0,0,0,0,0,0]`                    | E-STOP `base↔upper_arm`| `-0.0894`        |
| MJCF `home` keyframe `[0,-1.57,1.57,1.57,-1.57,0]` | E-STOP `base↔upper_arm`| `-0.0943`        |
| `q=[0,0,0,0,0,0.5]` (originally reported) | E-STOP `base↔upper_arm`| `-0.0894`        |

`base`↔`upper_arm` is a non-adjacent (2-hop: `base`→`shoulder`→`upper_arm`) pair
and is **not** in the manifest's `allowed_collision_pairs`.

**Effect:** if self-collision were enabled on the **manifest** model the kernel
would E-stop the arm at/near its mechanical home. NOTE — this does **not** affect
deployment today: `openral deploy sim` / `deploy run` lower so100 from its MJCF
(`lower_collision_params`), whose collision geoms are mesh-only → the kernel
receives `self_collision_enabled=False` and runs the scalar-envelope check only.
The manifest model is the **real-HW fallback** and must still be correct.

### Root cause

The so100 collision model is lowered via the **URDF random-pose sampling** path
(`select_lowering → "sampling"`; so100 has a URDF with usable collision meshes
and no SRDF). That path fits **one conservative PCA bounding capsule per link**
that must contain every mesh vertex (so it never under-covers — ADR-0030 §2).

so100's links are bulky, non-cylindrical brackets/blocks. A single capsule
over-approximates them badly:

- `base` mesh bbox is `0.111 × 0.096 × 0.083 m` (a solid block); its tightest
  conservative single capsule has **radius 0.0636 m** (the smallest of all three
  PCA-axis fits; the min bounding sphere is even larger at 0.070 m). It over-covers
  the real base by ~0.06–0.07 m in the thin directions.
- The `upper_arm` capsule swings within that ~6 cm phantom shell at home.

As a result the **capsule** distance `base`↔`upper_arm` is `-0.0894 m` at zero
while the **true mesh** clearance (MuJoCo `mj_geomDistance` oracle) is **+0.0494 m**
— a ~0.14 m fitting artifact. Over 200 000 reachable poses the capsule pair
overlaps in **99.81%** of configs (max clearance ever **+0.0006 m**), so it nearly
always fires — yet the sampling ACM rule only disables a pair colliding in
**100%** of the 2000-sample sweep (`== n_samples`); so100 hits 1994/2000, so the
pair stays *checked* and false-E-stops home. (The MJCF runtime path avoids this
with a separate "disable pairs overlapping at the neutral pose" rule
[`_neutral_pose_collisions`], which the URDF sampling path does not have.)

### Hazard analysis — why neither quick fix is acceptable (conservatism, CLAUDE.md §3)

Two "obvious" fixes were each evaluated against the **real geometry** and
**rejected as unsafe or infeasible**:

1. **Add `base`↔`upper_arm` to the ACM (mask it) — REJECTED as UNSAFE.**
   The pair is *not* genuinely always-in-collision: the real links clear by
   ~5 cm at home, and `base`↔`upper_arm` genuinely collides (true mesh distance
   ≤ 0) in **17.55%** of poses sampled **within the manifest's own
   `position_limits`** (the real-HW safety bounds; the wider `shoulder_lift`
   range folds the upper arm down onto the base far more than the URDF limits do).
   Crucially, replaying the masked model through the kernel's own capsule check
   shows **896 of 30 000 reachable poses** (over a separate sweep) where a genuine
   self-collision exists and `base`↔`upper_arm`'s capsule is the **only** pair
   that flags it — masking would turn those into silent blind spots. Masking
   therefore *removes* real safety coverage and is strictly less conservative.

2. **Re-fit a tighter single capsule — INFEASIBLE.**
   The committed capsule already equals the tool's output (the fleet drift guard
   `tests/unit/test_collision_lowering_fleet.py` is green) and is already the
   *tightest* conservative single primitive for the `base` block (smallest of the
   three PCA-axis radii; a sphere is larger). Any tighter capsule would drop mesh
   vertices → under-cover → less conservative.

The genuinely correct fix is **multiple capsules per link** so a bracket/block
link is covered by 2+ tight capsules instead of one fat one. The **C++ kernel
already supports this** (`collision.hpp` `capsule_link[]` / `capsules[]`; the
MJCF path emits multi-capsule today). The only blocker is the manifest loader
`openral_safety.envelope_loader._capsules_by_link`, which deliberately rejects
`>1 collision primitive` per link ("unsupported in ADR-0030 phase 2"), plus the
URDF lowering emitting a single PCA capsule. Lifting that restriction and
teaching the lowering to emit ≥2 capsules for bulky links is a safety-layer
change that **crosses a contract boundary and needs its own ADR** (CLAUDE.md §3,
§6) — out of scope for a targeted geometry fix.

### Decision (this PR)

**No code or geometry change.** A hand-edit to the ACM would be unsafe (item 1)
and a capsule re-fit is infeasible (item 2); the real fix is an ADR-gated
multi-capsule capability. This entry records the latent hazard, the evidence,
and the recommended path so the safety WG can prioritise the multi-capsule ADR.
Until then so100's real-HW fallback must **not** enable `self_collision_enabled`
on the manifest model without the multi-capsule fix (deployment is unaffected —
it uses the MJCF path, which disables manifest self-collision for so100).

**Conservatism:** documentation only — no enforcement path, threshold, limit,
geometry, ACM, or E-stop logic is changed. The model behaves exactly as before;
this entry prevents a future change from naively masking the pair.

### Verification (real C++ kernel + MuJoCo oracle)

- Real `safety_kernel_node` subprocess (built from this worktree, `BUILD_TESTING=ON`)
  driven with the committed so100 manifest + `self_collision_enabled=True`
  reproduced the three E-stops in the table above.
- MuJoCo `mj_geomDistance` over the so100 MJCF collision meshes is the independent
  oracle: +0.0494 m true clearance at home vs −0.0894 m capsule distance; 17.55%
  genuine collisions within manifest limits; 99.81% capsule overlap over 200 000
  reachable poses.

### Follow-up / resolution path (2026-06-22)

The "multi-capsule per link" fix floated above was **evaluated and proven
insufficient** for so100. The base is a near-cubic block (`0.111 × 0.096 ×
0.083 m`) and the `upper_arm` clears it by only +0.0494 m at home; a capsule's
**circular** cross-section must bulge ≥ ~0.04 m past flat block faces, so two
such shells (base ~0.04 + upper_arm ~0.035) sum to ~0.075 m > the 0.0494 m gap —
the capsule **union must overlap at home regardless of capsule count**. Three
decompositions confirm it (all preserve coverage and still catch the genuine
collisions, but none clears 0; single capsule = −0.0894):

- axis-split k=2 → −0.070
- PCA grid (base 3×3=9, ua 3×2=6 caps) → −0.029 (plateaus; worse beyond)
- VHACD convex decomposition (16+16 hulls) → −0.039 (plateaus)

The kernel already supports multiple capsules per link (`collision.hpp`
`capsule_link[]`/`capsules[]`; only the Python loader
`envelope_loader._capsules_by_link` gates `>1`), but capsules are the **wrong
primitive** here — the mismatch is the cross-section *shape*, not the count.

**The real fix is a box/OBB collision primitive** (rectangular cross-section):
a `BoxShape` in the `CollisionShape` union, allocation-free box–box / box–capsule
distance in the C++ hot path, and OBB-emitting lowering for blocky links. That
is a Layer-6 hot-path contract change — its own **ADR + maintainer pre-approval
+ safety-WG review**. Tracked in **issue #84**.

### Safety-WG reviewer gate

**This finding requires explicit sign-off from a safety-WG reviewer**, per
CLAUDE.md §3, to (a) confirm the "do not mask `base`↔`upper_arm`" conclusion and
the 17.55%/896-pose evidence, and (b) prioritise the box/OBB primitive (issue
#84) that is the real fix — multi-capsule was proven insufficient (above).

- [ ] **PENDING: safety-WG reviewer sign-off** (human gate — not author-clearable).

### Entry 005 — SO-101 same class, and the box/OBB fix (2026-07-05, ADR-0081)

The **SO-101** hit the identical failure mode live: an `openral deploy run` on
the real arm latched `/openral/estop` on the **first commanded action** of a
pen-pick, at the measured rest pose, with

```
safety.collision kind=self a=base b=lower_arm step=0 min_distance_m=-0.0779
```

and, once a per-pair ACM entry suppressed that pair, `a=base b=wrist` tripped at
the **same** −0.0779 m — the fat `base` capsule (radius 0.075 m) over-reports
every `base↔<distal>` pair. MuJoCo `mj_geomDistance` over the so101 collision
meshes is the oracle: true `base↔lower_arm` clearance at home is **+0.162 m**,
`base↔wrist` **+0.239 m** — no physical collision. Same near-cubic `base` block
as so100 (`0.111 × 0.096 × 0.072 m`).

**Fix (ADR-0081, this change):** the box/OBB primitive from Entry 004's
resolution path is now **implemented** — `BoxShape` in the `CollisionShape`
union; allocation-free `box_capsule_distance` (exact) + `box_box_distance`
(conservative SAT) in the C++ hot path; box params plumbed through the kernel +
`collision_params_from_description`; the so101 `base` lowered to a tight OBB (the
base-frame mesh AABB); the `so101_bench.yaml` ACM override **removed** (full base
self-collision restored). Offline verification (no `deploy run`): 36 kernel
gtests + full `ctest` green (incl. the `NoAlloc` box path); a MuJoCo-oracle test
(`tests/unit/test_so101_base_box_collision.py`) proves the home pose is
collision-free, the box clears where the capsule fired, the OBB encloses the base
mesh, and a driven-in penetration is still caught. Visual review via
`tools/viz_collision.py`.

**Update (2026-07-06) — full scope + live validation.** Boxing only the base
surfaced the *next* over-conservative pair (`shoulder↔lower_arm`): the SO-101 arm
links are rectangular brackets a single capsule over-reports by ~7–9 cm at the
pen VLA's compact folded operating poses. Root-caused with an **fcl non-convex
mesh oracle**: the true self-clearance across the VLA's whole distribution is
≈ 0 — the arm operates in **light self-contact by design** — so no zero-margin
geometric self-check can pass it. Final fix, all offline-verified then
**live-validated on the real SO-101**:

- **Every** so101 link is now an OBB (base + shoulder/upper_arm/lower_arm/wrist);
  over-report cut to ~1–4 cm. Each OBB encloses its link mesh (unit-tested).
- **`safety.self_collision_margin_m: -0.06`** (new `SafetyEnvelope` field)
  tolerates the grazing envelope while gross over-folds (elbow ≳ 125°, far OOD)
  still fire. The kernel's self / world / voxel margins are **separate** — this
  negative margin does NOT loosen arm-vs-world/octomap collision (verified in
  `lifecycle_kernel.cpp`). The real self-contact protection is the arm's
  force/torque limits (`max_torque_nm` / `contact_force_threshold_n`).
- **World/voxel checks extended to boxes** (`check_world_collision`,
  `check_voxel_collision`) so a boxed link stays visible to obstacle/octomap
  collision — closing a gap that boxing arm links would otherwise open.
- **Live result (2026-07-06):** pen VLA ran **452 chunks under TRT** with
  **zero `safety.collision` events**, unfolding the arm to reach the workspace;
  ended only on operator e-stop. Tests: 38 kernel gtests (self+world+voxel box)
  + the all-box offline oracle + schema/collision regression — all green.

**Conservatism (§3):** `box↔capsule` exact; `box↔box` / `box↔voxel` distance
lower bounds (never under-report); every OBB contains its link mesh; world/voxel
margins stay conservative + positive. The negative self-margin is a deliberate,
evidence-backed trade for a contact-operating arm.

- [x] **Safety-WG sign-off:** Approved by `AdrianLlopart` on 2026-07-07 for
  (a) the Layer-6 hot-path OBB + world/voxel box change, (b) the all-OBB so101
  model + OBB-encloses-mesh evidence, and (c) the `self_collision_margin_m:
  -0.06` trade (justified vs the fcl true-envelope clearance + force/torque as
  primary contact protection + the deliberate self-vs-world margin split).
- Follow-up (non-blocking): teach `openral collision lower` to emit OBBs for
  blocky links so the so101 entries are regenerable rather than hand-authored,
  and have `mjcf_lowering` emit boxes for MJCF box geoms instead of
  down-converting them to capsules.
