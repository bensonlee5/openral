# OpenRAL

An open-source operating layer for embodied AI, **OpenRAL** unifies fast policies, slow reasoning, and classical control into one typed, traceable, safety-first runtime for deployable robot agents.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral && cd OpenRAL
just bootstrap          # installs uv, ROS 2, system deps
just sync               # install Python workspace (wraps uv sync + repair)
uv run openral doctor        # verify your environment
just test               # run the test suite
```

## What does it do?

- Load any VLA (SmolVLA, π0, GR00T N1, OpenVLA) on any robot (SO-100, G1, UR5e).
- Type-safe, layer-isolated architecture — HAL → Sensors → World State → Skill → Reasoning → Safety → Observability.
- Skill packaging on HuggingFace Hub with versioned, license-aware manifests (sigstore provenance signing is planned, not yet implemented).
- Full OpenTelemetry traces per execution.
- LeRobotDataset v3 flywheel — every execution becomes a training row.
