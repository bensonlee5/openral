# Create a sim environment

This tutorial walks you through authoring a **`SimScene` YAML** — the
on-disk `(robot × scene × task)` tuple — that `openral sim run` consumes
together with an rSkill (`--rskill rskills/<id>`), so you can test a VLA /
rSkill against a task in simulation without touching hardware. The
runtime form the adapters see is the composed **`SimEnvironment`**
(`SimScene` + `RSkillManifest`); the YAML on disk never carries a
`vla:` block.

`SimScene` is the middle tier of the three-tier
scene hierarchy:

```
DeployScene  ⊆  SimScene  ⊆  BenchmarkScene
  (deploy run)    (sim run)    (benchmark scene / benchmark run)
```

This page focuses on the **`SimScene`** tier — the ad-hoc, single-rollout
shape consumed by `openral sim run`. Adding `metadata: {paper, honest_scope}`
+ non-`None` `seed` and `n_episodes` to a `SimScene` YAML turns it into a
**`BenchmarkScene`** that `openral benchmark scene` accepts; dropping the
`task:` block turns it into a **`DeployScene`** that `openral deploy sim`
accepts. Per-tier loaders refuse wrong-tier YAMLs at parse time.

It covers six things, in increasing depth:

1. The `openral sim run` flag surface and what is registry-resolved (i.e. **not**
   hardcoded).
2. Authoring a `SimScene` YAML for an **existing** robot, scene, task,
   and pairing it with an rSkill.
3. Bringing a **new** robot manifest (`robots/<id>/robot.yaml`) into sim.
4. Writing a **new scene adapter** (a new task suite or simulator wrapper)
   in Python, for cases that need custom robot, task, or physics behavior.
5. Writing a **new policy adapter** (a new VLA backend) and matching it to an
   rSkill.

The companion cookbook is [`scenes/README.md`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scenes/README.md).

## 1. What `openral sim run` accepts

`openral sim run` is defined in
[`python/sim/src/openral_sim/cli.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/cli.py).
Every axis — robot, scene, task, VLA, physics backend, device — is resolved at
runtime through one of three registries (no hardcoded IDs):

| Registry | Defined in | Populated by |
|---|---|---|
| `SCENES` | `python/sim/src/openral_sim/registry.py` | `@SCENES.register("<id>")` decorators in `adapters/*.py` |
| `POLICIES` | same | `@POLICIES.register("<id>")` decorators in `adapters/*.py` |
| `ROBOTS` | same | Auto-discovered from `robots/<id>/robot.yaml` at import time |

List everything that is currently registered on your install:

```bash
openral sim list
```

`openral sim list` is a sibling subcommand to `openral sim run`; it prints the three
registries (scenes / policies / robots) and exits without touching OTel or the
runtime path.

### Flags (`openral sim run`)

```
--config PATH                Path to a SimScene YAML (REQUIRED; strict —
                             DeployScene / BenchmarkScene YAMLs are rejected
                             with a redirect message pointing at
                             `openral deploy sim` / `openral benchmark scene`).
--rskill <weights_uri>       rSkill reference: rskills/<id>, bare name,
                             or HF repo id  (REQUIRED).
--robot ID                   robot_id override for free-axis scenes
                             (rejected on scenes that hard-fix a robot,
                              and on YAMLs that already set robot_id:).
--task  ID                   Override task.id (e.g. libero_spatial/3).
--instruction TEXT           Override the natural-language task instruction.
                             Wins over a scene's per-episode language (a
                             RoboCasa sampled-object string) — see §4.
--max-steps  N               Override task.max_steps.
--n-episodes N               Override SimScene.n_episodes.
--seed       N               Override the global seed.
--device     {cpu, cuda:0, mps, auto}
                             Torch device for the policy.
--save-dir   DIR             Where to write the JSON summary.
--save-video [PATH]          Write a per-episode MP4 (also enables frame capture).
--video-style {debug,world}  debug (default) = 3-panel montage; world = clean
                             single-view world render named
                             <scene>_<rskill>_<success|fail>.mp4 + videos.json
                             (for website hero clips; overlays drawn by the page).
--video-size INT             Square edge (px) for --video-style world (default 1024).
--view / --no-view           Open a passive mujoco.viewer.
--verbose / -v               DEBUG logging.
```

### Canonical invocation

```bash
openral sim run --config scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml \
            --rskill rskills/smolvla-libero
```

Both `--config` and `--rskill` are **required** — `openral sim run` always
composes a runtime `SimEnvironment` from a `SimScene` (the YAML)
and an `RSkillManifest` (the rSkill). There is no bare-CLI invocation
path; supply the scene + task in the YAML.

### Per-axis overrides on top of `--config`

Beyond the two required flags, the remaining options — `--robot` (only
on free-axis scenes), `--task`, `--instruction`, `--max-steps`,
`--n-episodes`, `--seed`, `--device`, `--save-dir`, `--save-video` —
**overlay** the loaded config (see `_load_or_build_env` in
[`cli.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/cli.py)),
so a single YAML can drive an entire task suite:

```bash
# Same VLA + scene; iterate through tasks.
for i in 0 1 2 3; do
    openral sim run --config scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml --rskill smolvla-libero --task "libero_spatial/$i"
done
```

If you need to swap an axis that *is* baked in, copy the YAML and edit it —
that is the supported pattern.

### Startup performance (`activate()` parallelisation)

`SimRunner.activate()` builds the env (MuJoCo XML compile / dataset
prefetch) and the policy (PaliGemma / NF4 quantization on π0.5, weights
load on SmolVLA) **concurrently** on a 2-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
Both factories only read the immutable `SimEnvironment` and share no
mutable state, so the wall-clock for `activate` collapses to
`max(env_ms, policy_ms)` instead of their sum — a meaningful win on
LIBERO / RoboCasa / GR1-tabletop where each side is 30–150 s.

On every invocation the runner logs a structured `sim_init_parallel`
record with `env_ms`, `policy_ms`, `total_ms`, and `saved_ms`, so you
can confirm the win for your specific (scene, VLA) combination.

To force the legacy sequential path (e.g. when interleaved logs would
obscure a profiling investigation), set
`OPENRAL_SIM_SEQUENTIAL_INIT=1`:

```bash
OPENRAL_SIM_SEQUENTIAL_INIT=1 openral sim run --config scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml --rskill pi05-libero-int8
```

See [GH-134](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/issues/134).

## 2. Author a SimScene YAML

The on-disk shape is a [`SimScene`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py)
— `(robot × scene × task)` — defined at `python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py:4728`.
At runtime the CLI composes it with the rSkill manifest (`--rskill`) into a
[`SimEnvironment`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py)
(`schemas.py:4598`) that adapter factories consume. Loading a YAML that
carries a `vla:` block raises `ROSConfigError` — policy *always* travels
on the CLI, not in the YAML.

Take an existing config as your starting point — for example,
[`scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml):

```yaml
# SimScene = scene + task. Policy is supplied at the CLI via
#   --rskill rskills/<id>

# robot_id: free-axis scenes only (LIBERO/MetaWorld/RoboCasa hard-fix the
# robot in the registry; setting it here on those scenes is a ROSConfigError).
# robot_id: franka_panda

scene:
  id: libero_spatial              # key into SCENES
  backend: mujoco                 # PhysicsBackend enum
  observation_height: 256
  observation_width: 256
  cameras: ["top", "wrist"]        # optional; SceneSpec.cameras defaults to []

task:
  id: libero_spatial/0            # adapter splits on "/" to resolve
  scene_id: libero_spatial        # MUST equal scene.id (validated post-init)
  instruction: ""                 # LIBERO overrides from suite metadata
  max_steps: 100
  success_key: is_success         # which info[] key marks success

seed: 42                          # optional on SimScene; defaults to 0
n_episodes: 1                     # optional on SimScene; defaults to 1
record_video: false               # optional; defaults to false
```

To promote this same scene to **paper-comparable** form, add a
`metadata: BenchmarkMetadata` block + set `seed` and `n_episodes` to
canonical values, then move the file to `scenes/benchmark/`. The
benchmark-tier sibling lives at
[`scenes/benchmark/libero_spatial.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scenes/benchmark/libero_spatial.yaml)
and adds:

```yaml
seed: 0                           # required (no default)
n_episodes: 500                   # required (no default; paper protocol)
metadata:
  paper: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11500"
  honest_scope: "..."             # honest scope statement; required
```

`openral sim run` loads the sim-tier sibling; `openral benchmark scene` loads
the benchmark-tier sibling. The per-tier loader (`load_scene_strict`)
rejects wrong-tier YAMLs — a `BenchmarkScene` YAML passed to `openral sim
run` returns a redirect message pointing at `openral benchmark scene`, and
vice versa.

### The required blocks

| Block | Schema | Required keys |
|---|---|---|
| `scene` | [`SceneSpec`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py) (`schemas.py:4285`) | `id`; `backend` defaults to `mujoco` |
| `task` | [`TaskSpec`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py) (`schemas.py:4500`) | `id`, `scene_id` (must equal `scene.id`) |
| `robot_id` | string, key into `ROBOTS` | Only on **free-axis** scenes — and only if you want to bake the robot into the YAML rather than passing `--robot`. Forbidden on `fixed_robot` scenes (LIBERO/MetaWorld/RoboCasa). |

Policy is **not** a YAML block; it is supplied at the CLI as
`--rskill rskills/<id>` → resolves to an `RSkillManifest`
(`schemas.py` — search for `class RSkillManifest`) and is composed onto the
runtime `SimEnvironment.vla` by `_load_or_build_env` in
[`cli.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/cli.py).
The Pydantic registries reject unknown ids with a list of valid ones, so
typos surface immediately. Run it:

```bash
openral sim run --config my_config.yaml --rskill rskills/<your_skill>
```

You will see a per-episode summary line and a `0` exit code on success.
The same runtime pattern also drives `openral benchmark run`. `openral deploy
run` is the hardware sibling; it consumes a `DeployScene` workcell YAML and lets
the reasoner select policy at runtime.

## 3. Add a new robot manifest

Robots are auto-registered from `robots/<id>/robot.yaml` at import time — no
Python edit required. The discovery loop lives at
[`python/sim/src/openral_sim/policies/robots.py:67-118`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/policies/robots.py).
The search path is, in order:

1. `$OPENRAL_ROBOTS_DIR/<id>/robot.yaml` (if the env var is set)
2. `<repo_root>/robots/<id>/robot.yaml`

Use [`robots/so100_follower/robot.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/robots/so100_follower/robot.yaml)
as a small (6-DoF + gripper) template; use
[`robots/franka_panda/robot.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/robots/franka_panda/robot.yaml)
for a 7-DoF arm. The required top-level blocks are:

| Block | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name`, `embodiment_kind`, `base_frame` | Identity + URDF root frame |
| `joints[]` | Per-joint: name, type, parent/child links, axis, limits, actuator |
| `end_effectors[]` | Gripper(s) / hand(s); kind, DoF, force/payload limits |
| `sensors[]` | Cameras / IMUs / etc.; each maps to a `vla_feature_key` |
| `capabilities` | Control modes, embodiment tags, lift / dexterity flags |
| `safety` | Workspace box, speed/force/torque limits, deadman flag |
| `observation_spec`, `action_spec` | State / action shapes and representations |
| `assets` (optional) | URDF / MJCF / SRDF reference block — see below |
| `sim` (optional) | MuJoCo joint↔qpos wiring consumed by `MujocoArmHAL.from_description` — see below |

### The `assets:` block

The robot's URDF / MJCF / SRDF are named once, at the top level, via the
unified `assets:` block. Every ref shares the
`openral_core.assets.resolve_asset` grammar:

```yaml
assets:
  # The MJCF that MujocoArmHAL loads. One of:
  #   rd:<module>          — robot_descriptions package (downloads on first use)
  #   gym_aloha:<scene>    — gym-aloha package asset
  #   openarm:bimanual     — Enactic OpenArm v2 (fetched on first use)
  #   file:<relpath>       — repo/manifest-relative explicit override
  mjcf: "rd:ur5e_mj_description"
  # Optional URDF (robot_state_publisher / collision lowering):
  # urdf:
  #   ref: "file:ur5e.urdf"          # or rd:<module> / ros2://robot_description
  #   root_frame: "base_link"         # robot_state_publisher root-frame wiring
  #   base_to_root_xyz_rpy: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  # Optional SRDF (seeds allowed_collision_pairs):
  # srdf: "file:ur5e.srdf"
```

### The `sim:` block

For any robot that should drive a MuJoCo digital twin through the shared
`MujocoArmHAL` base, declare a `sim:` block alongside `assets.mjcf`. The
runner reads it directly; no per-robot Python file is required — pass the
loaded manifest into `MujocoArmHAL.from_description(desc)`.

```yaml
sim:
  # The MJCF itself is named by `assets.mjcf` (above); this block carries
  # only the joint↔qpos/qvel/actuator plumbing.

  # Floating-base humanoids (G1, H1): qpos offset 7, qvel offset 6 are
  # derived automatically.  Single-arm robots can omit.
  floating_base: false

  # Explicit joint→qpos / →actuator overrides — only needed when the
  # MJCF declares joints in an order other than ``description.joints`` or
  # leaves passive follower qpos slots in between (OpenArm).
  # joint_qpos_addr:
  #   joint_a: 0
  #   joint_b: 1
  # actuator_index:
  #   joint_a: 0

  grippers:                                    # zero, one, or two entries
    - joint: "panda_gripper"                   # name from joints[]
      ctrl_range: [0.0, 255.0]
      qpos_addrs: [7, 8]                       # finger qpos indices
      qpos_scale: 0.08                         # 2 * 0.04 m max extent
      read_mode: "sum_over_scale"              # | "affine_low_high" | "passthrough"
      write_mode: "normalised"                 # | "passthrough"
      # actuator_index: 7                      # override; defaults to actuator_index map
      # mirror_actuator_index: 15              # Aloha: writes -ctrl to the negative finger

  # Connect-time hooks:
  # keyframe_index: 0          # mj_resetDataKeyframe(model, data, idx) — Aloha
  # seed_ctrl_from_qpos: true  # ctrl = qpos on connect — OpenArm v2
```

**Single source of truth.** When you add a `<ROBOT>_DESCRIPTION` Python
constant (e.g. `UR5e_DESCRIPTION` in `openral_hal/ur.py`), mirror the
`sim` block via `sim=SimDescription(...)` so the manifest-vs-YAML drift
guard (`tests/unit/test_robot_manifests_match_hal_constants.py`, plus
`tests/sim/test_data_driven_mujoco_hal.py::test_python_description_matches_yaml`)
stays green.

**Worked examples in tree** (use as templates):

| Robot | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `so100_follower` | single-arm + revolute Jaw (`read_mode: affine_low_high`) |
| `franka_panda` | single-arm + parallel gripper (`read_mode: sum_over_scale`) |
| `ur5e`, `ur10e`, `rizon4` | single-arm, no gripper, no overrides |
| `g1`, `h1` | floating-base humanoid (`floating_base: true`) |
| `aloha_bimanual` | bimanual + two passthrough grippers with `mirror_actuator_index` + `keyframe_index: 0` |
| `openarm` | bimanual + two passthrough grippers + explicit `joint_qpos_addr` skipping passive follower fingers + `seed_ctrl_from_qpos: true` |

### Drop a new robot in

```bash
mkdir -p robots/my_arm
$EDITOR robots/my_arm/robot.yaml        # copy & adapt so100_follower/robot.yaml
$EDITOR robots/my_arm/README.md         # pair the manifest with adapter notes
```

### Verify it registered

```bash
openral sim list | grep "robots:"
# should now include `my_arm`
```

You can also confirm the manifest loads cleanly from Python:

```python
from openral_sim import ROBOTS
robot = ROBOTS.get("my_arm")()         # invokes the cached factory
print(robot.name, len(robot.joints))
```

### Match the manifest to a sim scene

Every scene adapter expects a specific embodiment. LIBERO assumes a 7-DoF arm
with a parallel gripper; MetaWorld assumes the Sawyer. For your new robot to
run end-to-end you also need either (a) a scene adapter that knows how to drive
it, or (b) the `mock` scene, which accepts any action dimensionality (see §4).

---

## 4. When the existing scene adapters are **not** enough

Reach for the Python adapter path (Section 5) when the registered scene
catalogue cannot express the task you need. Common reasons:

- You want a completely different arena (no LIBERO floor / table).
- You want a different robot than a benchmark suite hard-wires.
- You want objects or fixtures the existing suite adapter cannot spawn.
- You want physics independent of robosuite (e.g. a mock scene or a
  non-MuJoCo backend).

---

## 5. Write a custom scene adapter

A scene adapter is a function decorated with `@SCENES.register("<id>")` that
returns an object satisfying the
[`SimRollout`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/rollout.py)
Protocol:

```python
class SimRollout(Protocol):
    scene: SceneSpec
    task:  TaskSpec
    def reset(self, seed: int | None = ...) -> Observation: ...
    def step(self, action: NDArray[np.float32]) -> StepResult: ...
    def render(self) -> NDArray[np.uint8] | None: ...
    def close(self) -> None: ...
```

`Observation` is a free-form dict; adapters SHOULD include `"images"`
(dict of HWC uint8 RGB frames), `"state"` (1-D float32), and `"task"`
(natural-language instruction). `StepResult` is a 5-tuple-shaped dataclass
(`observation`, `reward`, `terminated`, `truncated`, `info`) — the runner
reads success from `info[task.success_key]`.

The smallest working scene adapter lives in
[`python/sim/src/openral_sim/policies/mock.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/policies/mock.py).
It is the recommended reference because it has no physics and no external
dependencies. The realistic reference is `adapters/libero.py` (wraps the
LIBERO gymnasium env).

### Skeleton

Place new adapters under `python/sim/src/openral_sim/{policies,backends}/` so they are
imported by the package's `__init__.py` (which is what triggers the
`@register` side-effect):

```python
# python/sim/src/openral_sim/{policies,backends}/my_scene.py
from __future__ import annotations
from dataclasses import dataclass

import numpy as np
from numpy.typing import NDArray

from openral_sim.registry import SCENES
from openral_sim.rollout import Observation, StepResult


@dataclass
class _MyScene:
    scene: "SceneSpec"
    task:  "TaskSpec"
    _step: int = 0

    def reset(self, seed: int | None = None) -> Observation:
        self._step = 0
        return self._observe()

    def step(self, action: NDArray[np.float32]) -> StepResult:
        self._step += 1
        done = self._step >= self.task.max_steps
        return StepResult(
            observation=self._observe(),
            reward=0.0,
            terminated=done,
            truncated=False,
            info={self.task.success_key: done},
        )

    def render(self) -> NDArray[np.uint8] | None:
        return np.zeros(
            (self.scene.observation_height, self.scene.observation_width, 3),
            dtype=np.uint8,
        )

    def close(self) -> None:
        return None

    def _observe(self) -> Observation:
        return {
            "images": {"camera1": self.render()},
            "state":  np.zeros(8, dtype=np.float32),
            "task":   self.task.instruction,
        }


@SCENES.register("my_scene")
def _build(env_cfg: "SimEnvironment") -> _MyScene:
    return _MyScene(scene=env_cfg.scene, task=env_cfg.task)
```

Then wire it into the package's import set so `@register` actually fires.
The simplest way is a one-line import in
`python/sim/src/openral_sim/{policies,backends}/__init__.py`:

```python
from . import my_scene  # noqa: F401  # reason: register-by-import
```

Confirm it shows up in `openral sim list` under **scenes:**.

### Optional: `mujoco_handles` for `openral sim run --view`

If your adapter wraps a MuJoCo model and exposes
`mujoco_handles(self) -> tuple[mujoco.MjModel, mujoco.MjData] | None`,
`--view` will open a passive viewer. The method is intentionally **not** part
of the `SimRollout` Protocol — the runner uses `getattr(env,
"mujoco_handles", None)`, so non-MuJoCo adapters need not stub it.

### Worked example — `so101_box` (custom arena + custom objects + non-Panda robot)

[`python/sim/src/openral_sim/backends/so101_box/`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/backends/so101_box/)
is a reference for the "custom arena + custom robot + custom task"
shape this section targets. It registers `so101_box`
(fixed_robot=`so101_follower`) and ships an SO-101 in a configurable
box arena with an OAK-D Pro RGB-D overhead camera, a wrist camera
parented to the gripper, a slotted target block + cylindrical tube as
the task, and a geometric tube-insertion success check.

Two design points worth lifting into your own adapter:

* **Every scene parameter is YAML, no geometry is hard-coded.** The
  composer is fed a single typed `BoxSceneOptions` dataclass that
  carries every dimension, pose and threshold. The CLI's
  `scene.backend_options` block populates it via
  `_options_from_backend_options` (which rejects unknown keys
  loudly). Once the adapter is registered, the next "SO-101 in a
  similar arena" scene is a pure YAML edit — no Python change. See
  [`scenes/sim/so101_tube_insertion.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scenes/sim/so101_tube_insertion.yaml)
  for the full surface.
* **The MJCF is composed by reading the upstream robot MJCF, then
  rewriting + appending.** `compose_so101_box_mjcf` reads
  `robot_descriptions:so_arm101_mj_description` (the SO-101 MJCF
  shipped with `TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100`), re-anchors its
  `<body name="base">` to the configured world pose via a regex
  rewrite, splices a `<camera>` into the gripper body, and appends
  the arena + objects + overhead camera to the worldbody just before
  `</worldbody>`. The result is written next to the upstream MJCF so
  `meshdir="assets"` resolves at compile time without copying any
  STLs. Same pattern as `openarm_robosuite`.

If your custom scene also needs RGB + depth from the same camera, the
`so101_box` rollout shows the convention: two `mujoco.Renderer`
instances on the same model, one with `enable_depth_rendering()` set,
both updating against the same camera by name. The depth array is
in metres directly (no normalisation) so the policy / dataset bridge
sees the same units the real OAK-D Pro driver emits.

## 6. Write a custom policy adapter

A policy adapter is a function decorated with `@POLICIES.register("<id>")`
that returns an object satisfying the
[`PolicyAdapter`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/policy.py)
Protocol:

```python
class PolicyAdapter(Protocol):
    spec: VLASpec
    device: str
    def reset(self) -> None: ...
    def step(self, observation: Observation, instruction: str) -> NDArray[np.float32]: ...
    def close(self) -> None: ...
```

The simplest reference is `_ZeroPolicy` / `_RandomPolicy` in
[`adapters/mock.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/sim/src/openral_sim/policies/mock.py)
(no weights, CPU-only, end-to-end test on any machine). The realistic
reference is `adapters/smolvla.py` (loads a `SmolVLAPolicy`, normalises the
observation dict, caches action chunks).

### Skeleton

```python
# python/sim/src/openral_sim/{policies,backends}/my_policy.py
from __future__ import annotations
from dataclasses import dataclass

import numpy as np
from numpy.typing import NDArray

from openral_sim.registry import POLICIES
from openral_sim.rollout import Observation


@dataclass
class _MyPolicy:
    spec: "VLASpec"
    device: str
    action_dim: int = 7

    def reset(self) -> None:
        # load weights / reset action queue / re-seed RNG here
        return None

    def step(self, observation: Observation, instruction: str) -> NDArray[np.float32]:
        # adapter is responsible for mapping observation → its input format
        del observation, instruction
        return np.zeros(self.action_dim, dtype=np.float32)

    def close(self) -> None:
        return None


@POLICIES.register("my_policy")
def _build(env_cfg: "SimEnvironment") -> _MyPolicy:
    return _MyPolicy(spec=env_cfg.vla, device=env_cfg.vla.device)
```

Wire it in via the same `adapters/__init__.py` import pattern as §4.

### Pair it with an rSkill manifest

The runner enforces that `vla.weights_uri` is a valid skill reference and that
the rSkill manifest's `embodiment_tags` overlap the robot's (see
`openral_sim.runner._check_rskill_compatibility`). To use your policy
with real weights, create `rskills/<my-skill>/rskill.yaml` declaring the
target embodiment(s), then reference it as
`rskills/<my-skill>`. The skills directory layout is documented
under `rskills/README.md`; existing manifests (e.g. `rskills/smolvla-libero/`)
are the practical templates.

If your rollout needs to write a LeRobotDataset v3 via the bridge
(`openral sim run --dataset-out`), declare BOTH `state_contract`
AND `action_contract` on the manifest:

```yaml
# Per-checkpoint proprioception layout — bridge's observation.state shape.
state_contract:
  dim: 8        # e.g. 7 joint + 1 gripper for Franka+LIBERO
# Per-checkpoint action vector — bridge's action shape.
action_contract:
  dim: 7        # e.g. 7-D delta-EEF for pi05/smolvla/xvla/act on LIBERO
```

The dataset bridge reads these contracts (not the robot manifest)
because the same physical robot can host many checkpoints with
different I/O dims (Franka emits 7-D delta-EEF on LIBERO, 12-D for
RoboCasa, 8-D joint+gripper on real hardware). The scene's
`observation_height/width` flows through as the bridge's per-camera
shape.

### Optional: `last_input_frame` for video capture

Visuomotor adapters MAY also implement
`last_input_frame(self) -> NDArray[np.uint8] | None`. When present and
`record_video` is `True`, the runner stitches the frame the VLA actually saw
into the debug MP4. Scripted / mock policies should omit it.

### End-to-end smoketest

Compose your new scene and policy with an existing robot to confirm
everything is wired:

```bash
openral sim run \
    --config  scenes/<your-config>.yaml \
    --rskill  rskills/<my-skill> \
    --n-episodes 1 \
    --max-steps  10
```

(Substitute `<my-skill>` for the rSkill manifest you wrote alongside
your `<my-config>.yaml`; the runner refuses to load a manifest whose
``embodiment_tags`` do not overlap the resolved robot's, so the smoketest
fails loud on mismatches.)

---

## Level 6: a custom MuJoCo environment via RoboCasa

**RoboCasa** is a `openral sim` backend so you can run kitchen
scenarios with custom robots, tasks, and rSkills against real MuJoCo
physics.

### One-time setup (auto-installed on first use)

`openral_sim._deps.ensure_backend_deps` handles the install chain for
you. On the **first** `openral sim run` against a `robocasa/<task>` scene
id, you see a Rich banner listing every subprocess step plus the
license posture, then a `typer.confirm()` prompt:

```bash
openral sim run --config scenes/sim/robocasa_pnp.yaml \
            --rskill rskills/rldx1-ft-rc365-nf4 \
            --max-steps 200
```

Banner steps (kitchen variant):

1. `uv sync --all-packages --group robocasa`
2. `mkdir -p ~/.cache/openral/repos`
3. `git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite.git ~/.cache/openral/repos/robosuite` (idempotent, master branch — kitchen needs the master tip, not the 1.5.2 PyPI wheel. Master adds `make mink optional` (commit `95743f6`, 3 commits past the v1.5.2 tag) so `mink` stays in `extras_require`; without that, `mink==0.0.5`'s `numpy<2` pin would wedge the workspace. The lockfile-honest `[tool.uv.sources] robosuite = { git = "…", rev = "…" }` entry in `pyproject.toml` pins the exact commit `_robocasa_kitchen_plan` reinstalls editable here.)
4. patch the clone: `touch robosuite/examples/__init__.py`, `touch robosuite/examples/third_party_controller/__init__.py`, `touch robosuite/macros_private.py` (upstream `find_packages()` drops the `examples/` directory + the macros nag is silenced by an empty `macros_private.py`)
5. `uv pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -e ~/.cache/openral/repos/robosuite`
6. `uv pip install --no-deps "robosuite-models @ git+..."`
7. `uv pip install h5py>=3.16 lxml>=5 llvmlite numba qpsolvers pyopengl-accelerate`
8. `uv pip install --no-deps "mink==0.0.5"` (newer mink relocated `mink.tasks.exceptions.TargetNotSet` away from where robosuite's `mink_controller.py` imports it; `--no-deps` avoids the numpy<2 downgrade)
9. `uv pip install --no-deps "robocasa @ git+..."`

Confirm with `y` and walk away — total install runs in ~30 s on
fibre. Skip the prompt in CI / Dockerfiles with `OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1`.

After the deps land, the same command auto-fetches the ~11 GB
CC-BY-4.0 kitchen asset bundle into `~/.cache/openral/robocasa/`
behind a second Rich license banner (gated by
`typer.confirm()` or `OPENRAL_ALLOW_ROBOCASA_ASSETS=1`).

The `libero` extras-group conflict means **you cannot share a venv
with LIBERO**. The workspace's `[tool.uv].conflicts` block declares
this so `uv sync` refuses an impossible mix; if you need both
backends, use two clones (or two venvs against the same clone).

The auto-installer also handles a number of upstream-bug workarounds
transparently: `robocasa/__init__.py`'s hardcoded
`mujoco==3.3.1` / `numpy==2.2.5` / `robosuite>=1.5.2` assertions (upstream
kitchen 1.0.1) — or `mujoco==3.2.6` / `numpy in {1.23.x, 1.26.4}` /
`robosuite in {1.5.0, 1.5.1}` (robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks 0.2.0 fork) — are
bypassed at adapter import-time via `_spoof_robocasa_version_pins`;
the controller config's missing-actuator entries are stripped before
they reach robosuite. See "Known constraints" below for the full set.

### Running with a RoboCasa-365 checkpoint

`rskills/rldx1-ft-rc365-nf4` wraps the verified RoboCasa-365 PandaMobile
rSkill. It runs through the same three-camera, 16-D state, 12-D action
contract as the RoboCasa scene.

```bash
OPENRAL_ALLOW_ROBOCASA_ASSETS=1 \
  uv run openral sim run --config scenes/sim/robocasa_pnp.yaml \
                    --rskill rskills/rldx1-ft-rc365-nf4 \
                    --view --max-steps 200
```

What that config wires together:

- `robot_id: panda_mobile` -- the `robots/panda_mobile/robot.yaml`
  manifest (Franka Panda on a 3-DoF holonomic base).
- `scene.id: robocasa/PickPlaceCounterToCabinet` -- one of the curated
  atomic tasks registered with `SCENES.register(...,
  fixed_robot="panda_mobile")` so an accidental `--robot franka_panda`
  fails fast with `ROSConfigError`.
- `scene.backend_options.mode: prebuilt` -- validated through
  :class:`openral_core.RoboCasaBackendOptions` (prebuilt-vs-procedural
  XOR).
- `--rskill rskills/rldx1-ft-rc365-nf4` -- the verified RoboCasa-365
  manifest that declares the embodiment tags / sensor requirements the
  runner validates.

The first invocation fetches the ~11 GB CC-BY-4.0 kitchen asset bundle
under `~/.cache/openral/robocasa/`. The download is gated by
`typer.confirm()`; `OPENRAL_ALLOW_ROBOCASA_ASSETS=1` is the CI
bypass. The fetch script also needs the mujoco-version spoof, which the
asset helper does in a subprocess `-c` wrapper.

### Authoring a procedural kitchen

For free-axis authoring, pass `--scene robocasa` (no slash) plus a
procedural `backend_options` block:

```yaml
scene:
  id: robocasa
  backend: mujoco
  backend_options:
    mode: procedural
    kitchen_style: 3      # 0..9, one of robocasa's 10 aesthetic packs
    layout_id: 7          # 0..9, one of robocasa's 10 floor plans
    fixtures: ["sink", "stovetop", "microwave"]
    spawn_objects: ["coffee_cup", "apple"]
    task_verb: pnp        # pnp | open | close | press | navigate
    robots: ["PandaMobile"]
    controller: BASIC
    horizon: 500
```

`task_verb` resolves to the matching atomic env (e.g. `pnp` →
`PickPlaceCounterToCabinet`); the remaining keys are validated by
`RoboCasaBackendOptions`'s `model_validator` to enforce the
prebuilt-vs-procedural XOR.

### Known constraints

- **mujoco / numpy / robosuite assertion.** Both robocasa variants
  hard-assert exact micro versions of mujoco, numpy, and robosuite at
  import time even though all three work fine on newer versions in
  practice. The RoboCasa adapter (`openral_sim/backends/robocasa.py:
  _spoof_robocasa_version_pins`) monkey-patches the `__version__`
  strings *only* across the robocasa import block and restores them
  immediately afterwards so the rest of the workspace is unaffected.
- **`examples/` / `macros_private.py` patches.** The auto-installer
  clones robosuite + the robocasa fork to
  `~/.cache/openral/repos/`, drops the missing `__init__.py` files
  under `robosuite/examples/`, and writes empty `macros_private.py`
  stubs into both packages. Without these patches every run emits a
  `Could not load the mink-based whole-body IK` WARN (robosuite's own
  `__init__.py:37` import) + 3 `No private macro file found` lines
  per package. See the `_robocasa_*_plan` install steps in
  `openral_sim/_deps.py` for the full list.
- **No LIBERO in the same venv.** `[tool.uv].conflicts` enforces this
  cleanly when both groups would be active; swap venvs (or clones)
  when you need both backends.
- **One informational print remains.**
  `robocasa.__init__` does `try: import mimicgen` + `print()`
  unconditionally; installing mimicgen IS a real fix but mimicgen's
  own `__init__` imports robosuite paths the current master has
  renamed and prints 2 new warning lines, so the net noise is worse
  with mimicgen than without. We leave the one print.

## Level 7: NVIDIA GR-1 tabletop tasks (RoboCasa GR1 fork)

The [RoboCasa GR1 Tabletop Tasks](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks)
fork — a soft fork of robocasa that NVIDIA shipped alongside the
**GR00T N1** open foundation model
([arXiv:2503.14734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14734)) — adds 24 PnP
tabletop tasks on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid (the
`GR1ArmsAndWaistFourierHands` composition: 7-DoF right arm + 7-DoF
left arm + 3-DoF waist + two 6-DoF Fourier dex hands, leg and head
actuation disabled). The bot-harness sim layer exposes them as
`robocasa/gr1/<TaskName>` scene ids pinned to the `gr1` robot
manifest (`robots/gr1/robot.yaml`).

The two `robocasa`-named python packages (kitchen + GR1 fork) **share
the python package name**, so a host installs ONE or the OTHER -- the
auto-installer picks the variant matching the scene id you requested.
The adapter still registers both task families regardless; the
unavailable one fails at `robosuite.make()` with a clean "unknown
env_name" rather than at import time.

### One-shot run

Drive the GR1 tabletop scene with the in-tree RLDX-1-FT-GR1 nf4 rSkill
via the auto-managed sidecar:

```bash
OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1 \
OPENRAL_ALLOW_ROBOCASA_ASSETS=1 \
OPENRAL_ALLOW_NONCOMMERCIAL=1 \
  openral sim run --config scenes/sim/robocasa_gr1_pnp_cup_to_drawer.yaml \
              --rskill rskills/rldx1-ft-gr1-nf4 --max-steps 30
```

This drives a real `robosuite.make(env_name="PnPCupToDrawerClose",
robots=["GR1ArmsAndWaistFourierHands"])` rollout on the local GPU.

Drop the env-var bypasses on first run for the interactive prompts:

1. `robocasa_gr1` deps banner → `y` (clones robosuite + the GR1 fork
   to `~/.cache/openral/repos/`, installs both editable with the
   `examples/__init__.py` + `macros_private.py` patches dropped in).
2. `RoboCasa GR1 tabletop assets` license banner → `y` (~750 MB
   download to the cloned fork's `robocasa/models/assets/`).

### Sweeping to the other 23 tasks

Swap `scene.id` + `scene.backend_options.prebuilt_task` + `task.scene_id`
in `scenes/sim/robocasa_gr1_pnp_cup_to_drawer.yaml` to any of the 24
tabletop env class names (see `_GR1_TABLETOP_TASKS` in
`openral_sim/backends/robocasa.py`):

- `PnPCupToDrawerClose` / `PnPPotatoToMicrowaveClose` /
  `PnPMilkToMicrowaveClose` / `PnPBottleToCabinetClose` /
  `PnPWineToCabinetClose` / `PnPCanToDrawerClose` — the 6 canonical
  PnP atomic tasks.
- 18 `Posttrain*` variants (Cuttingboard → Basket / Cardboardbox /
  Pan / Pot / Tieredbasket / Plate / etc.) — the post-training task
  set from the GR00T-N1 paper.

### Benchmark protocol

`benchmarks/gr1_tabletop.yaml` mirrors the paper's eval protocol
(scaled to 10 episodes for a ~30 min single-GPU run; bump
`n_episodes` + `seeds` together for the 50-ep paper reproduction):

```bash
openral benchmark run --suite gr1_tabletop --rskill rskills/<gr1-skill>
```

The auto-install prompts fire from the benchmark runner's path too —
`openral benchmark run` and `openral sim run` share the same scene factory.

## Where to go next

- The full list of registered IDs on your machine: `openral sim list`.
- The cookbook of existing configs and a per-backend ID table:
  [`scenes/README.md`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scenes/README.md).
- Design background: the original scene/eval design renamed
  `SceneEnvironment` to `SimScene` and later split it into the
  three-tier `DeployScene ⊆ SimScene ⊆ BenchmarkScene` hierarchy (with
  per-tier loader strictness) that also underlies the `openral sim run`
  vs `openral benchmark run` split. RoboCasa was added as a free-axis
  MuJoCo backend with custom robots + tasks — rolling out in five PRs per
  [issue #88](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/issues/88);
  the Pydantic `RoboCasaBackendOptions` validator and the
  `[dependency-groups].robocasa` extras group already ship today, the
  adapter and a Level-6 procedural-kitchen walkthrough land in later
  PRs.
- The public-symbol inventory for the sim layer:
  [`docs/METHODS.md`](../../METHODS.md), section **Eval (sim)**.
