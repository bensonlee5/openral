# Architecture Decision Records — index

This directory holds OpenRAL's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). The format and
ground rules are set by [ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md):

> One file per decision, **monotonically numbered**. Immutable once accepted — to reverse
> or contradict a decision you write a **new** ADR that marks the prior one *Superseded*;
> you never renumber, merge, or delete an accepted record. Factual corrections and status
> updates may be added in place as dated **Amendments**.

Because the log is append-only, the file count only ever grows. The point of this index is
to keep that growing log **navigable**: ADRs are grouped below by topic cluster, each with
its current status and its relationships to other ADRs. When a decision evolves, look for
the highest-numbered ADR in its cluster — that is usually the live one.

**Legend** — Status: `Accepted` (decided; may be partly or fully implemented) · `Proposed`
(written, not yet ratified/landed) · `Superseded` (replaced by a later ADR). Relations:
*extends / builds on* (additive), *amends* (in-place correction of an earlier ADR),
*supersedes* (replaces an earlier decision or sub-decision).

> **Maintainers:** this index is hand-maintained. When you add an ADR, add a row to the
> right cluster here **and** a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml`. Per [ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)
> the source ADR files are the normative record; this table is a convenience map over them.

## Notes for future consolidation

These are observations for maintainers — **not** licence to renumber or delete records
(forbidden by [ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)). Consolidation here means
*better cross-links and overviews*, not fewer files.

- **The `0028` family** (`0028`, `0028b`, `0028c`, `0028d`) is one decision split across four
  files; `0028` is internally labelled "0028a". When this work is fully landed, a short
  amendment at the top of `0028` summarising the final shape would let readers skip the split.
- **Collision** (`0020` → `0030` → `0040` → `0053`) and **spatial memory** (`0035` → `0038`
  → `0052`, with `0037`/`0051` on detection) are the two longest evolution chains; the
  highest number in each is the current design.
- Many cluster-B/D ADRs are still `Proposed` despite landed implementations. A status-only
  amendment pass (additive, dated) would make the index reflect reality without touching
  decisions.
