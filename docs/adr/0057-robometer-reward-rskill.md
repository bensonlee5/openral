# ADR-0057 — `kind: reward` rSkills: robotic reward models as parallel task-progress monitors

- **Status:** Accepted 2026-06-15. Phases 0–5 + the live deploy-sim co-activation
  all validated empirically on an 8 GB GPU (load, NF4, scorer, reasoner tool,
  and a live openarm deploy-sim run). See the **2026-06-16 amendment** below for
  the pre-quantized meta-load, determinism, frame-bound, and co-activation wiring.
  **Amended 2026-07-07** (see the **2026-07-07 amendment** below): the reward
  model now loads lerobot's in-tree `lerobot.rewards.robometer.RobometerRewardModel`
  with plain `transformers` — no pinned `robometer` package, no
  `transformers==4.57.1`, no dedicated venv — and the reward camera now defaults
  to the first RGB camera in `robot.yaml`.
- **Date:** 2026-06-15
- **ADR number:** `0057`. `0056` is claimed by the in-flight
  `feat/multi-detector-locate` branch (on-demand detectors as reasoner tools);
  the integer is not load-bearing — cross-refs use filenames.
- **Related:**
  - ADR-0047 — `kind: vlm` scene VLM as a read-only `query_scene` Reasoner tool.
    The reward monitor is the same shape (read-only, S2-cadence, advisory,
    in-process reward scorer) but emits **scalars** (progress/success) instead of
    free-form text. `query_scene` is the *escalation target* when the reward
    signal is ambiguous.
  - ADR-0056 — on-demand detectors as prompt-able Reasoner tools; same
    "auxiliary perception runs parallel to the VLA and feeds the Reasoner"
    pattern, with `locate_in_view` as a sibling read-only tool.
  - ADR-0046 — GR00T runtime co-residency constraints; the reward monitor follows
    the same explicit VRAM budgeting discipline.
  - ADR-0037 — `kind: detector` + the GStreamer perception bus / tee that
    supplies frames on real hardware.
  - ADR-0018 §4 — the Reasoner has no actuation authority over read-only tools;
    the reward signal is advisory (CLAUDE.md §1.1).

## Context

A `kind: vla` policy emits action chunks but carries no notion of whether it is
*succeeding*. Today the Reasoner infers success indirectly — absence of errors,
`query_scene` text answers, world-state changes — but has no continuous,
normalized per-frame progress/success signal. Without one, a stalled or failing
rollout runs to a timeout instead of triggering replanning.

[`robometer/Robometer-4B`](https://huggingface.co/robometer/Robometer-4B) (paper
*Robometer: Scaling General-Purpose Robotic Reward Models via Trajectory
Comparisons*, arXiv 2603.02115, **Apache-2.0**) is a Qwen3-VL-4B reward
foundation model that, given a rollout's frames + a task instruction, predicts
per-frame **progress** and per-frame **success** probability. That is exactly
the missing signal. The question this ADR answers: how does such a model live in
OpenRAL, and how does its output reach the Reasoner?

### What was validated before deciding (gating spike)

- **Load** (Phase 0): the on-disk `config.json` says `architectures: ["RFM"]`
  but the class is `RBM`, with **no `auto_map` and no Hub-side modeling code** —
  vanilla `AutoModel` cannot load it. It loads only via the upstream `robometer`
  package (`load_model_from_hf`), which **requires `transformers==4.57.1`** (5.x
  changes processor kwargs and drops `input_ids`). Discrete (binned) mode yields
  per-frame progress ∈ [0,1] + per-frame success ∈ [0,1]; continuous mode yields
  raw regression values.
- **Quantize** (Phase 2): NF4 (the repo's `Linear.numel ≥ 4M → Linear4bit` rule)
  takes 8.91 GB bf16 → **3.33 GB resident / 3.56 GB peak** (8-frame forward),
  output intact — **4.44 GB headroom** on an 8 GB GPU.
- **Run in parallel** (Phase 3): the scorer streamed a real rollout video and
  produced **progress 0.21 → 0.88 with success spiking to 0.90 at task
  completion**. Parallel-to-VLA on 8 GB is feasible alongside a small NF4 VLA.

## Decision

1. **Add a new rSkill kind, `reward`** (`RSkillKind`), with a `RewardContract`
   manifest block (`progress_range`, `success_threshold`, `preference`,
   `frame_window_s`, `target_fps`, `num_bins`, `instruction_required`). It joins
   `detector` / `vlm` as a perception kind: embodiment-agnostic, `actuators_required`
   empty, no action/state contract, no VLA preprocessing — enforced in
   `RSkillManifest._check_kind_consistency`. A new `RSkillAction.MONITOR` verb
   labels it. Backward-compatible additive change (no `schema_version` bump, no
   migrator) — every existing manifest still validates.

2. **Run it in-process inside `reward_monitor_node`** via lerobot's in-tree
   `RobometerRewardModel`, loading OpenRAL's pre-quantized NF4 weights directly.
   This keeps the reward VLM out of the VLA runner, reasoner, and HAL processes
   without an additional ZMQ boundary.

3. **Abstract the frame source** so the same skill works in **sim and real**:
   the reward monitor subscribes to a `sensor_msgs/Image` camera topic —
   GStreamer tee on real hardware, sim HAL camera publisher in `deploy-sim`.
   Not GStreamer-bound.

4. **Surface it as a read-only Reasoner tool** (`QueryTaskProgressTool` /
   `query_task_progress`), not an `ExecuteSkill`. The Reasoner co-activates the
   reward rSkill with a VLA; the node continuously ingests frames into a
   rolling window; the Reasoner queries it on demand for the windowed assessment
   (`progress_now`, `success_now`, trends, `stalled`) and uses it to continue,
   escalate to `query_scene`, advance, or enter the replanning ladder. **The
   signal is advisory only** — it never actuates and never suppresses a
   `ROSSafetyViolation`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Reuse `kind: vlm` + `query_scene`.** Rejected for semantic clarity: a reward
  model emits structured per-frame scalars with a contractual range/threshold,
  not free-form text. Folding it into `vlm` would overload that kind's
  open-vocab-QA meaning and lose the typed `RewardContract`. The two are
  complementary — `query_scene` is the escalation target when reward is ambiguous.
- **Continuous push topic** (monitor publishes a progress stream the Reasoner
  subscribes to). Rejected in favor of continuous-ingest + on-demand query: the
  Reasoner pulls the windowed assessment when it wants context, which matches its
  event-driven cadence and avoids a high-rate topic the Reasoner would have to
  debounce. The rolling buffer still gives it history ("over the last X s").
- **In-process with the VLA.** Rejected: a 4 B VLM contends with the VLA on the
  GPU step loop; keeping it in the reward-monitor ROS node preserves process
  isolation from the control path while avoiding an extra transport boundary.

## Consequences

- New `reward` kind + `RewardContract` + `MONITOR` action in `openral_core`
  (additive). `_EMBODIMENT_AGNOSTIC_KINDS` and `_PERCEPTION_KINDS` gain `reward`.
- A new runner backend (`openral_runner.backends.reward`) + Reasoner
  tool + co-activation wiring.
- 8 GB co-residency is real but workable: NF4 both models, keep the frame window
  bounded (activation peak scales with window / resolution / `num_bins`), or run
  the reward monitor on CPU / a 2nd GPU / a cloud host.
- The runtime uses lerobot's in-tree `RobometerRewardModel` with plain
  `transformers`; no pinned upstream `robometer` runtime package is executed.
- Reward output is advisory; it can never gate motors or be on the control path.

## Amendment — 2026-06-16: pre-quantized meta-load, determinism, frame-bound, co-activation

Validated the production path end-to-end on an 8 GB RTX 4070, including a live
openarm `deploy-sim` run with the reasoner and the reward monitor co-active.

- **Pre-quantized meta-load.** A published NF4 checkpoint
  (`OpenRAL/rskill-robometer-4b-nf4`, built by `tools/build_robometer_nf4_checkpoint.py`)
  loads DIRECTLY as 4-bit: build the RBM skeleton on the `meta` device, install
  empty `Linear4bit` shells, `Params4bit.from_prequantized` the packed weights,
  and assign the folded non-persistent rotary buffers. ~1.7 s to install the
  weights (process→ready ≈25 s, dominated by the model-graph build + imports, not
  weights) vs ~110 s + a 19 GB transient CPU spike for the bf16-load-then-quantize
  path. Proven **bit-identical** to that path (same-process `max|Δ| = 0`; 4-bit
  dequant round-trip `0`). Shared helpers in `tools/_robometer_quant.py`; the
  scorer picks the meta path for a `*nf4*` repo or a local pre-quantized dir,
  else the bf16 build path.
- **Determinism.** The reward ramp is made byte-stable across process launches by
  forcing the math SDP kernel + `use_deterministic_algorithms(True)` +
  `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8` + `cudnn.allow_tf32=False`. (Without this, a
  warmed vs cold process drifts ~0.006 purely from flash/mem-efficient SDP kernel
  selection — not the load path.)
- **Bounded activation.** The vision-transformer forward's activation memory
  scales with the number of frames × resolution; a full 8 s × 3 fps window of
  640×480 frames needs ~4.7 GiB and OOMs the 3.3 GB-resident model on 8 GB even
  with no VLA. `RobometerInProcessReward(max_frames=8)` evenly subsamples the window
  (`_evenly_spaced_indices`, end-inclusive) to keep the forward co-resident with
  the sim (and a small NF4 VLA). Logged, never silent.
- **`local://` weights.** A `kind: reward` manifest's `weights_uri` may be
  `local:///abs/dir` (offline / pre-publish / air-gapped pre-quantized checkpoint);
  the runtime strips the scheme and the scorer meta-loads it. `hf://org/repo[@rev]`
  unchanged.
- **Deploy-sim co-activation.** `sim_e2e.launch.py` gains opt-in
  `enable_reward_monitor` (default off): brings up `reward_monitor_node` PARALLEL
  to the VLA (a plain `Node` — it stays co-active, not a lifecycle/VRAM peer the
  reasoner frees) and sets the reasoner's `task_progress_available=True` so the
  `query_task_progress` tool is offered only when a monitor is live. The reward
  camera auto-resolves from `robot.yaml` (the VLA's RGB camera). CLI:
  `openral deploy sim --enable-reward-monitor [--reward-monitor-manifest <yaml>]
  [--reward-monitor-task <str>]`. The S2 system prompt now tells the reasoner to
  poll the monitor when it sees fit to judge a running skill (advisory).
- **Live result.** openarm deploy-sim, no GStreamer: reward service up, scorer
  meta-loaded (3.32 GB), `subsampling 19 → 8 frames`, and `query_task_progress`
  returned `ok=True, progress=0.561, success=0.283` over the live sim camera.

## Amendment (2026-07-07) — native lerobot loader replaces the pinned `robometer` venv

The gating spike (Phase 0) concluded that the RBM class had no `auto_map` and
could only be loaded via the upstream `robometer` package pinned to
`transformers==4.57.1`, forcing an isolated sidecar venv. lerobot 0.6.0 removes
that constraint: it ships the reward model in-tree as
`lerobot.rewards.robometer.RobometerRewardModel` — a vanilla
`AutoModelForImageTextToText` (Qwen3-VL-4B) with three prediction heads, loadable
with plain `transformers` (>=5).

**What changed:**

- `RobometerInProcessReward` now loads `RobometerRewardModel` from lerobot's
  native module inside `reward_monitor_node`. There is **no** pinned `robometer`
  git package, **no** `transformers==4.57.1` force-pin, and **no** dedicated venv.
  The reward model is still isolated from the VLA runner / reasoner / HAL by the
  reward-monitor ROS process boundary.
- The NF4 pre-quantized weights (`OpenRAL/rskill-robometer-4b-nf4`, ~3.3 GB
  resident) are kept: the scorer meta-builds the native `RobometerRewardModel`
  skeleton and drops the packed 4-bit weights in directly (remapped into the
  native module) — no bf16 spike, no Qwen weight download.
- Per-frame progress is decoded via the module-level `decode_progress_outputs`
  on `_compute_rbm_logits`, not the native `compute_reward` (which returns only a
  scalar), preserving the discrete-mode per-frame progress ∈ [0,1] + success ∈
  [0,1] contract.
- The reward camera now defaults to the first RGB camera listed in `robot.yaml`
  (falling back to `agentview_left`), with no camera-name override.

**Unchanged:** the `reward` rSkill kind, `RewardContract`, the stateless-scorer /
node-side `RollingFrameBuffer` split, the advisory-only guarantee, and the
`deploy-sim` `--enable-reward-monitor` co-activation wiring.
