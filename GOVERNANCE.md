# OpenRAL Governance

This document describes how the OpenRAL project is run and how decisions are
made. It is intentionally lightweight and reflects the project's current,
early-stage reality; it will grow as the community does.

## Roles

### Project Lead
OpenRAL is currently led by **Adrian Llopart** (@AdrianLlopart). The lead has
final say on direction, breaking changes, and releases, and is responsible for
keeping that authority accountable to the principles in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and to the maintainers.

### Maintainers
Maintainers review and merge PRs, triage issues, and own areas of the codebase
via [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS). They are listed in the
`@openral/maintainers` team. New maintainers are nominated by an existing
maintainer after a sustained track record of high-quality contributions and
confirmed by the project lead.

### Safety Working Group
Because OpenRAL drives physical actuators, the **Safety Working Group**
(`@openral/safety`) has mandatory review authority over everything under
`packages/openral_safety/` and `cpp/openral_safety_kernel/`. A safety-WG
reviewer, an update to the safety hazard log (private `OpenRAL/management`
repo), and tests proving the change is *at least as conservative* are
required for any safety-touching change (see CLAUDE.md §3).
Safety reviewers can block a change on safety grounds regardless of other
approvals. For hazard reports or coordinated safety disclosure, email security@openral.dev
with "[safety]" in the subject line.

### Contributors
Anyone who opens an issue or PR. You do not need to be a maintainer to
contribute — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How decisions are made

1. **Day-to-day changes** (bug fixes, features, docs) are decided by normal PR
   review: at least one maintainer approval, CODEOWNERS satisfied, CI green.
2. **Architectural changes that cross a layer boundary** require an
   **Architecture Decision Record**, authored in the private `OpenRAL/management`
   repo (see [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md)), before implementation
   (CLAUDE.md §3, §4.2).
3. **Safety-critical changes** additionally require Safety Working Group
   sign-off as described above.
4. **Disagreements** are resolved by discussion first. If consensus cannot be
   reached, the project lead decides. As the project grows, a Technical
   Steering Committee (TSC) will be formed to take on this role; this section
   will be updated when that happens.

## Changing this document

Changes to governance are made by PR and require project-lead approval. Once a
TSC exists, governance changes will require a TSC vote.
