"""``openral robot vendor-urdf <id>`` — expand an upstream xacro to a flat URDF.

The flat, committed URDF means end users need no xacro tooling at runtime
(ADR-0058). The xacro-only arms (ur5e/ur10e/rizon4) ship a ``XACRO_PATH`` in
``robot_descriptions``; we let ``robot_descriptions``' ``yourdfpy`` loader run
``xacrodoc`` to expand every ``${…}`` substitution, then serialize the resulting
flat URDF with a provenance header. ``openarm`` ships only MJCF upstream, so its
flattened URDF is cloned separately and passed as a ``file:`` upstream; the
``--rename`` hook strips the ``openarm_`` joint/link prefix to the OpenRAL HAL
convention (``left_joint1..7`` / ``right_joint1..7``).

**Raw-text mode** (``raw_text=True``). The yourdfpy round-trip absolutizes /
mangles ``package://`` mesh paths, which is fatal for already-flat upstream
URDFs that ship relative or ``package://`` meshes (so100/so101/gr1/h1). For
those we copy the upstream text verbatim and apply joint-name renames with
``re.sub`` directly on the raw XML — preserving every mesh path byte-for-byte.
The renames target **joint names only** (``<joint name="X"`` and any
``joint="X"`` mimic/transmission references); link names are never touched. A
:class:`list` of ``(pattern, repl)`` pairs is applied in order, so so100/so101
take six numeric renames and gr1/h1 take one ``_joint``-suffix strip.
