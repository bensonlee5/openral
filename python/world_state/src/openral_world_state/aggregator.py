"""WorldStateAggregator — tf2-aware, injectable snapshot producer.

Collects joint state, sensor image refs, EE poses, base pose, and battery
level from injected update callables and produces a ``WorldState`` Pydantic
snapshot on demand.

Diagnostics
-----------
Every tracked component (joint state, each sensor bundle, each EE) gets a
per-key entry in ``WorldState.diagnostics``:

- ``"ok"``    — updated within ``staleness_limit_s``
- ``"stale"`` — not updated within ``staleness_limit_s``
- ``"error"`` — reserved; set by callers via :meth:`set_error`

Staleness entries are **latched**: once a component goes stale it stays
``"stale"`` in the diagnostics dict until a fresh update arrives.  This
makes the diagnostic history visible to the Reasoner even across snapshot
boundaries.

Hot path
--------
:meth:`snapshot` is the only hot-path method.  It acquires a lock, samples
all injectable state, classifies staleness, and returns an immutable Pydantic
model.  All update methods are designed to be called from subscriber
callbacks in the ROS 2 node wrapper.

Example:
    >>> import time
    >>> from openral_core import (
    ...     RobotDescription,
    ...     EmbodimentKind,
    ...     JointSpec,
    ...     JointType,
    ...     RobotCapabilities,
    ...     SafetyEnvelope,
    ...     ControlMode,
    ... )
    >>> from openral_core.schemas import JointState
    >>> from openral_world_state.aggregator import WorldStateAggregator
    >>> desc = RobotDescription(
    ...     name="test",
    ...     embodiment_kind=EmbodimentKind.MANIPULATOR,

    >>> ws = agg.snapshot()
