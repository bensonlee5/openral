"""IoU-gated object memory.

Pure, ROS-free, stateful. Holds a table of remembered ``DetectedObject``s with
stable track ids. Associates new lifted candidates by label + 3D AABB IoU,
freezes matched objects (no re-write of a known object), creates tracks for new
ones, and evicts objects that were in view but not re-detected (they may have
moved). Out-of-view objects are retained — the camera looking away is not
evidence of absence.
