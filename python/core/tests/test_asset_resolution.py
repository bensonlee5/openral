"""All-robots asset resolution + URDF/MJCF/SRDF validity.

The user's explicit "test everything for all robots": every ``robots/*/robot.yaml``
is parametrized through :func:`openral_core.assets.resolve_asset` and its declared
assets are loaded with the real parser for their kind (``yourdfpy`` for URDF,
``mujoco`` for MJCF, the safety-kernel SRDF parser for SRDF).

Principled skips/xfails only — no faked passes:

* MJCF that needs an absent optional sim dep → ``pytest.skip`` (never faked).
* ``menagerie:`` refs are not yet wired (Task 1 YAGNI); ``widowx``'s MJCF
  therefore *must* raise :class:`AssetRefError`, which the test asserts rather
  than skipping (the honest outcome).
* h1, so100_follower, so101_follower left this table under the standardized
  asset-resolution grammar — each ships a vendored, joint-name-patched URDF
  (``robots/<id>/<id>.urdf``) whose joints
  match the manifest, so all three PASS the cross-check with no safety-lowering
  drift. h1's ``package://h1_description`` meshes resolve location-independently;
  so100/so101 use *relative* mesh paths, so their Apache-2.0 mesh assets are
  vendored alongside under ``robots/<id>/assets/`` (with the upstream LICENSE) —
  the lowering re-fits identically from the vendored meshes.
* gr1 still :data:`xfail`: its upstream (Wiki-GRx-Models) URDF is **GPL-3.0**, a
  copy-left license that CLAUDE.md §1.9 rejects from open-core without TSC
  review, so it cannot be vendored into the repo. It keeps its ``_joint``-suffix
  xfail and its ``rd:`` ref.
