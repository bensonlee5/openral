    Lets the generic HAL camera rig (``openral_hal._camera_rig``) splice a
    manifest camera into a bare-arm MJCF that ships no ``<camera>`` elements, so
    a ``deploy sim`` digital twin renders the robot's declared cameras without a
    per-robot scene composer. A camera is a property of the robot's sensor suite
    (the wrist camera is bolted to the gripper; the overhead camera is a declared
    sensor), so its sim pose lives on the :class:`SensorSpec`, not in a scene.

    The rig only splices a camera that is *absent* from the loaded MJCF, so this
    is a no-op for scene-attached or already-composed models (those carry their
    own cameras).

    Attributes:
        parent_body: MJCF body the camera is rigidly mounted to (tracks that
            body's pose — e.g. the gripper/``Fixed_Jaw`` for a wrist camera).

            third-person camera).
        pos: Camera position ``(x, y, z)`` in metres, in ``parent_body``'s frame
            (or world when ``parent_body`` is ``None``).
        target: Look-at point ``(x, y, z)`` in the same frame; the camera's
            MuJoCo ``-z`` view axis is oriented from ``pos`` toward it.
        up: World-up hint used to level the camera roll. Defaults to ``(0, 0, 1)``.
            A camera physically mounted upside-down (e.g. a wrist phone bolted
            inverted on the gripper) uses ``(0, 0, -1)`` to roll the image 180°.
        fovy_deg: Vertical field of view in degrees. ``None`` derives it from the

            uses :attr:`name` for the world-state contract (it's the
            URDF-shaped logical identifier the safety supervisor sees
            on every chunk); a separate ``sim_joint_name`` lets a
            sim-adapter look up ``mj_name2id`` without hardcoding
            robosuite / robocasa / MuJoCo naming conventions in
            backend modules. ``None`` means "the MJCF joint name
            matches :attr:`name`" — true for every fixed-base
            manipulator we ship; only mobile bases and humanoids
            whose MJCF auto-prefixes joints (robosuite's
            ``mobilebase0_…`` namespace, GR-1's ``robot0_…``) need
            it. See ADR-0025.

            runner / safety / dataset-bridge code identifies grippers
            and base DoFs by this tag instead of substring-matching the
            joint name (which silently misclassifies any joint
            containing ``"gripper"``, e.g. ``"gripper_pose"``). Default
            ``"unknown"`` keeps legacy manifests loadable; the fleet
            annotates incrementally per ADR-0028a.
        origin_xyz: Fixed translation (metres) of this joint's frame in
            its ``parent_link`` frame — the URDF ``<joint><origin xyz>``.
            With :attr:`origin_rpy` and :attr:`axis_xyz` it gives the

            (from MJCF/URDF) only for robots that enable self-collision
            checking — legacy manifests are unaffected.
        origin_rpy: Fixed orientation (roll, pitch, yaw, radians) of this

        middleware: ROS 2 middleware selection.
        onboard_compute: Onboard compute descriptors.
        sdk_kind: Whether the SDK is open or closed.
        hal: Simulation + real-hardware HAL import strings. ``deploy sim``
            constructs ``hal.sim`` (or derives ``MujocoArmHAL`` from
            :attr:`sim`); ``deploy run`` constructs ``hal.real``. ADR-0031.
        observation_spec: VLA observation configuration.
        action_spec: VLA action configuration.
        sim: Optional MuJoCo wiring consumed by

            references identifying the **planar mobile base** joints.
            When the robot has a holonomic / differential / omnidirectional

        allowed_collision_pairs: Link-name pairs excluded from
            self-collision (adjacent links touch by design); the

            the SRDF ``disable_collisions`` block (named by
            :attr:`AssetRefs.srdf`). ADR-0030.
        compute_edge: Compute spec for the on-robot accelerator (e.g. Jetson
            AGX Orin SoC).  Populated by ``openral detect`` when a Jetson /
            embedded SoC is found.  Falls back to ``compute_local`` when
            ``None`` (tethered robot, SoC not yet probed).  ADR-0069.

            ADR-0069.
        compute_cloud: Optional remote compute endpoint (SSH or HTTPS).
            Set manually or via ``openral detect --target cloud``.
            ADR-0069.

            to the *model*'s expected input feature name (e.g.
            ``agentview``). Empty means pass through unchanged. SmolVLA
            LIBERO usually wants ``{"camera1": "image", "camera2": "image2"}``.
        norm_tag: Normalization statistics tag for policies that use
            multiple checkpoints or training distributions (e.g. MolmoAct2
            with ``norm_tag="so100_so101_molmoact2"`` for SO-100/101
            finetuned weights). Optional; ``None`` means the adapter's
            default tag applies. Used by ``predict_action`` methods to
            select the right norm_stats entry at inference time.
        image_max_crops: Cap on the number of image tiles a multi-crop
            image processor (Molmo / MolmoAct2 family) produces per camera
            frame. Each extra 378px crop adds ~182 pooled image tokens and

            ~3.5 GiB; what overflows an 8 GiB card is the crop activations).

``simpler_*``) are joint-space slices (potentially across multiple

runner serves verbatim from ``observation.joint_state.position``; a
robot.yaml with the matching joint count dispatches them without an

class StateContractBindings(BaseModel):
    """Per-robot source bindings for an rSkill's `state_contract.layout`. ADR-0027.

    Symmetric to :class:`ControlModeSemantics` on the action side
    (``joint_order`` + ``reference_frame`` + ``gripper_convention``):
    the rSkill manifest names the *shape* via :attr:`StateContract.layout`;
    these bindings name the *sources* on the deploying robot. The
    layout-adapter registry (``openral_state_adapter``) joins shape +
    bindings + live :class:`sensor_msgs/JointState` + live ``/tf`` into
    the per-checkpoint state vector.

    Bindings are required for layouts in :data:`WRAPPED_TASK_SPACE_LAYOUTS`
    and forbidden otherwise (the joint-space layouts have no source to
    parameterise).

    Attributes:
        eef_frame: tf2 link name of the end effector
            (e.g. ``"panda_hand"``). Required for any layout reading
            EE position / orientation.
        base_frame: tf2 link name of the mobile base
            (e.g. ``"base_link"``). Required for any layout reading
            base position / orientation OR base-relative EE poses.
        world_frame: tf2 root frame the base pose is expressed in
            (default ``"map"`` — slam_toolbox publishes ``map → odom →
            base_link``). Set to ``"odom"`` for deployments without SLAM.
        gripper_qpos_joints: ``JointState.name`` entries whose positions
            populate the gripper-width slot(s) of the layout, in the
            order the policy expects (e.g. ``["panda_finger_joint1",
            "panda_finger_joint2"]``). Empty for grasper-less robots
            or layouts without a gripper slot.
        quaternion_convention: Component order of any quaternion in the
            assembled vector. ROS / TF2 default is ``"xyzw"`` (the
            ``geometry_msgs/Quaternion`` field order). Some upstream
            checkpoints expect ``"wxyz"`` — declare it here so the

    """Build the canonical :class:`ActionSlot` layout for a representation.

    ADR-0036. The skill_runner calls this to expand a skill that declares
    only ``ActionContract.representation`` (no explicit ``slots``) into a
    typed slot layout it can dispatch. Joint representations return
    ``None`` so the caller keeps the legacy whole-vector ``JOINT_POSITION``
    path; cartesian / gripper representations get one slot per control
    mode, addressed at the robot's primary end-effector
    (``description.end_effectors[0]``).

    :class:`EndEffectorSpec` carries no explicit tf-frame field, so the
    end-effector's ``name`` is used as the slot ``frame`` (the EE name is
    the tf frame the cartesian pose/delta is expressed in for the
    canonical embodiments).

    Args:
        rep: The VLA's declared action-vector representation.
        dim: Dimensionality of the policy's flat action vector.
        description: The target robot — its primary end-effector names

    Returns:
        For joint representations: ``None`` (caller keeps the legacy
        whole-vector ``JOINT_POSITION`` path). Otherwise a list of typed
        :class:`ActionSlot` s that satisfy the per-slot validators.

    Raises:
        ROSConfigError: If the representation needs an end-effector but
            ``description.end_effectors`` is empty, or if ``dim`` is too
            small for the layout (``DELTA_EE_6D`` / ``CARTESIAN_POSE``

    RLBench PyRep sidecar, …) and that adapter — not the coarse
    :class:`PhysicsBackend` and not the individual scene instance — fixes which
    :class:`ControlMode` s the policy's flat action vector is interpreted as.
    Many scenes share one adapter (the four LIBERO suites, RoboCasa's ~100

``"any"`` as the explicit **embodiment-agnostic wildcard**.

``"any"`` is the *declared* way to say "this rSkill runs on every embodiment"
(ADR-0072): perception kinds (``detector`` / ``vlm`` / ``reward``) and ``playbook``
decision procedures use ``embodiment_tags: ["any"]``. An empty ``embodiment_tags``
is rejected by :meth:`RSkillManifest._check_embodiment_tags_present` — agnosticism
must be declared, never derived from an empty list (CLAUDE.md §1.4). The rSkill↔robot
gate (``openral_rskill.loader.rSkill.check_embodiment_tags``) treats ``"any"`` in a
skill's tags as match-any; a robot never declares ``"any"``.

``"mobile_base"`` is a CLASS tag (not a specific robot): any robot with a planar
base + ``body_twist`` actuator declares it so base-only rSkills (Nav2
NavigateToPose, etc.) can target the whole class without naming each specific
mobile platform. Robot-specific tags (e.g. ``"panda_mobile"``) coexist on the
same ``RobotDescription`` for skills that DO depend on the specific composition.

The ``RSkillManifest.embodiment_tags`` field is restricted to this set so a
typo or framework hint (``lerobot``, ``libero``) cannot land in a manifest
where the loader's compat check would silently never match. When
``"custom"`` is used, the manifest MUST also populate
``embodiment_extra`` (see :class:`EmbodimentExtra`); the cross-validator
on :class:`RSkillManifest` enforces this. ADR-0013.

            every frame and streams ``ObjectsMetadata`` into
            ``WorldState.detected_objects``; the reasoner reads it **passively**
            (via world state / ``recall_object``) and never prompts it. It is
            **not** an ExecuteSkill-dispatchable tool and carries no actuation
            authority. RT-DETR (closed vocab) and OmDet-Turbo (frozen open
            vocab) are continuous. The reasoner may still toggle it via
            ``LifecycleTransitionTool`` to free VRAM (ADR-0050).
        ON_DEMAND: A prompted locator the reasoner invokes only when it needs
            to find a specific object **right now**. Surfaces the read-only
            ``locate_in_view`` tool (ADR-0043) backed by an open-vocabulary
            detector; it is not run continuously. LocateAnything is on-demand.

    The two modes cleanly separate "open-vocabulary" from "prompting":
    continuous detectors cover a fixed bank of classes the reasoner reads for
    free; the on-demand locator handles the long tail that bank does not cover.

    Example:
        >>> DetectorMode.CONTINUOUS.value
        'continuous'
        >>> DetectorMode.ON_DEMAND.value

        input_size: Model input resolution as ``(width, height)`` in pixels.
            Both dimensions must be > 0.  Default ``(640, 640)`` matches the
            RT-DETR / D-FINE default export resolution.

            Default ``0.5``.

    Carries the configuration a robotic **reward / progress-monitor** model
    (e.g. Robometer-4B, a Qwen3-VL-4B reward foundation model) needs to score
    a rollout. A reward skill runs in parallel with a ``kind: "vla"`` policy,
    continuously ingesting the VLA's camera frames into a rolling window, and
    emits per-frame **progress** ∈ ``progress_range`` and per-frame **success**
    probability. The Reasoner queries it on demand (``QueryTaskProgressTool``)
    to decide whether to continue, escalate to a scene VLM, advance, or replan.
    The signal is **advisory only** — it never actuates and never gates motors
    (CLAUDE.md §1.1).

    Required when :attr:`RSkillManifest.kind` is ``"reward"``; forbidden for all
    other kinds (enforced by :meth:`RSkillManifest._check_kind_consistency`).
    Like ``detector`` / ``vlm``, a reward skill is a pure perception consumer:
    it emits no Action chunks and requires no actuators.

    Attributes:
        progress_range: ``(min, max)`` of the normalized per-frame progress
            scalar. Default ``(0.0, 1.0)`` — Robometer's discrete/binned mode
            (see :attr:`num_bins`) emits progress already in ``[0, 1]``.
        success_threshold: Per-frame success probability at/above which the
            frame is considered a task success. In ``[0.0, 1.0]``; default
            ``0.5``.
        preference: Whether the model also exposes a trajectory-preference
            head (Robometer does). Default ``False`` — the progress/success
            path is the Reasoner-facing contract; preference is future work.
        backend: Which reward runtime scores this skill (ADR-0057). ``"robometer"``
            (default) → the fine-tuned Robometer RewardModel in-process;
            ``"topreward"`` → the zero-shot TOPReward monitor (lerobot
            ``TOPRewardModel``, per-frame progress from a prefix sweep of
            ``P("True" | video, instruction)``), run in-process. Selects the
            backend in ``build_reward_monitor``; existing manifests default to
            ``"robometer"`` so behavior is unchanged.
        frame_window_s: Length of the rolling frame buffer in seconds. The node
            evicts frames older than this relative to the newest. Must be > 0.
        target_fps: Frame-sampling rate fed to the model (Robometer's example
            uses 3 fps). Must be > 0. This is an S2-cadence monitor, not a
            per-control-step signal.
        num_bins: Discrete-mode bin count for the progress head. Robometer's
            discrete mode yields per-frame normalized progress in ``[0, 1]``;
            continuous mode yields raw regression values. Must be > 0;
            default ``100``.
        instruction_required: Whether a natural-language task instruction must
            accompany the frames (Robometer requires one). Default ``True``.
        check_floor: Below this progress value the attempt is clearly not done
            → no VLM adjudication, straight to the replanning ladder. Must be
            ≤ ``success_threshold``; default ``0.4`` (calibrated for robometer's
            loose/general eval distribution that wanders ~0.55-0.78).
        plateau_window_s: Trailing window (seconds) over which
            ``progress_trend ≈ 0`` indicates the policy has stopped getting
            closer to the goal. Default ``3.0``.
        plateau_tolerance: ε band absorbing critic noise when deciding whether
            the trend is flat. Default ``0.05``.
        default_patience_s: Baseline execution ceiling (seconds) used as a
            backstop before the Reasoner escalates. Default ``30.0``.

    Example:

    A **playbook** is a human-authored standard-operating-procedure — a
    structured Markdown document describing *how the S2 Reasoner should approach
    a class of task*: its trigger, the ordered decision steps it composes from
    existing reasoner tools, the bound on those steps, and its verifiable
    acceptance (``done``) predicate. It is **content the reasoner reads, never
    code it executes**, and carries no weights, actuators, ROS server, or Action
    contract — the symbolic counterpart to a ``vla`` policy.

    Required when :attr:`RSkillManifest.kind` is ``"playbook"``; forbidden for
    all other kinds (enforced by :meth:`RSkillManifest._check_kind_consistency`).
    The ``body_uri`` Markdown body is what the reasoner injects into its system
    prompt (or retrieves by ``trigger`` similarity at scale); the manifest
    ``description`` + ``trigger`` drive selection. Advisory only — a playbook
    changes what the LLM *decides*, never its actuation authority: every motion
    it triggers is still an ``ExecuteRskill`` → Action chunk → C++ safety kernel
    (CLAUDE.md §1.1).

    Attributes:
        trigger: Natural-language description of when this playbook applies.
            Used as the retrieval key when more playbooks are installed than
            fit the system prompt (the deferred ``load_playbook`` tool).
        body_uri: Repo-relative path to the Markdown SOP (e.g. ``"./PLAYBOOK.md"``).
        composes_tools: The ``ReasonerToolCall`` discriminators the SOP uses
            (``execute_rskill``, ``recall_object``, ``locate_in_view``,
            ``query_scene``, ``query_task_progress``, ``memory_write``,
            ``memory_search`` …). Advisory — a manifest-level hint of the
            playbook's tool surface; at least one entry is required.
        done_predicate: Natural-language acceptance test the playbook verifies
            before declaring success (e.g. ``"the target object is in the
            gripper"``).
        max_steps: Hard bound on the number of tool calls before the playbook

class RSkillManifest(BaseModel):
    """Pydantic model of the ``rskill.yaml`` package manifest (V1).

    This is the on-disk schema for an rSkill HF Hub repo. An rSkill is
    loaded by capability-checking against a :class:`RobotDescription`,
    selecting a runtime + quantization, then constructing a runtime
    :class:`~openral_rskill.Skill` instance.

    ``schema_version`` is ``"0.1"``: the manifest surface has had no
    backward-incompatible change. Now the repo is published it is
    versioned for real (CLAUDE.md §1.6) — a backward-incompatible change
    bumps it and ships a migrator, while backward-compatible additions
    (ADR-0013/0022/0024) evolve the surface in place.

    ADR-0013 added two symmetric guards on top of the initial V1 shape:

    1. **``actuators_required``** mirrors ``sensors_required`` on the
       output side. Every skill declares at least one
       :class:`ActuatorRequirement`; the loader validates it against
       :attr:`RobotDescription.action_spec`. ``n_dof`` and
       ``vla_action_key`` are auto-filled from the robot YAML for the 9
       canonical embodiments; for ``"custom"`` they must be set on the
       manifest.

    2. **``embodiment_extra``** is the explicit escape hatch for
       embodiments that do not have a canonical
       ``robots/<id>/robot.yaml``. Required iff ``"custom"`` appears in
       :attr:`embodiment_tags`; forbidden otherwise.

    V1 already tightened: ``name`` / ``fallback_skill_id`` must be
    HF-Hub-shaped, ``version`` is SemVer, ``weights_uri`` is restricted
    to ``hf://`` or ``local://``, ``embodiment_tags`` is closed to the
    set of in-tree-supported robots (now including ``"custom"``), and
    ``benchmarks`` replaces the old free-form ``metadata`` blob with a
    typed dict of canonical suite ids → success rate. Commercial-use
    posture is derived from :attr:`license` via
    :attr:`is_commercial_use_allowed`.

    Attributes:
        schema_version: On-disk format version. ``"0.1"`` today.
            Backward-compatible extensions (ADR-0013/0022/0024) evolved
            the surface in place; now the repo is published, a
            backward-incompatible change bumps this and ships a migrator
            (CLAUDE.md §1.6).
        name: HF Hub identifier, e.g. ``"openral/rskill-pick-cube-so100"``.
            Must match ``<owner>/<repo>``.
        version: SemVer string of the rSkill package itself (not the
            wrapped weights).
        license: License posture (surfaced at install time).
            Drives :attr:`is_commercial_use_allowed`.
        role: rSkill slot. ``"s1"`` for fast policies (the only slot
            currently loaded via :func:`rSkill.from_yaml` — 100% of
            in-tree skills); ``"s0"`` reserved for cerebellar realtime
            (humanoid balance, C++ only); ``"s2"`` reserved for slow
            reasoning.
        model_family: Closed VLA / policy family. Drives the runner's
            adapter dispatch.
        embodiment_tags: Robot embodiments this rSkill targets. Must
            intersect a robot's ``RobotCapabilities.embodiment_tags`` for
            the loader to accept. Restricted to the canonical set
            (:data:`EmbodimentTag`) so typos / framework hints cannot
            silently always-miss. ``"custom"`` is the explicit hatch
            (see :attr:`embodiment_extra`).
        embodiment_extra: ADR-0013. When ``"custom"`` is in
            :attr:`embodiment_tags`, declares the sensor + actuator
            surface of the custom rig so the loader's compat check
            still has something to match against. MUST be ``None`` when
            ``"custom"`` is not present.
        capabilities_required: Per-flag capability requirements (subset of
            :class:`RobotCapabilities` boolean fields). The loader rejects
            installation on a robot that does not satisfy every flag.
        sensors_required: Sensor inputs the policy expects from the
            robot. See :class:`SensorRequirement`.
        actuators_required: ADR-0013. Symmetric output-side
            contract: at least one :class:`ActuatorRequirement`
            entry. The loader matches each entry's :attr:`kind` against
            :attr:`RobotDescription.action_spec.control_mode` and
            auto-fills :attr:`ActuatorRequirement.n_dof` /
            :attr:`vla_action_key` from the canonical robot YAML
            (predefined embodiments only — for ``"custom"`` they must
            be set on the manifest).
        runtime: Preferred inference runtime.
        quantization: Default :class:`QuantizationConfig` for this rSkill.
        weights_uri: HF Hub revision-pinned URI to weights or local
            path reference. Production deployments pin a SHA
            (CLAUDE.md operating principle 8).
        chunk_size: Action-chunk length the policy emits per
            :meth:`Skill.step`. Drives the ChunkedExecutor's overlap
            schedule and shows up in the trace surface.
        latency_budget: Latency contract enforced by CI on the reference
            host (CLAUDE.md §7.4).
        min_vram_gb: Optional minimum VRAM (GB) the skill needs per
            quantization dtype. Informational — the loader uses it for
            ``ral skill check`` / ``openral doctor``; the actually-applied
            dtype is still pinned by ``quantization.dtype`` (CLAUDE.md
            §11 forbids silent downcast).
        fallback_skill_id: rSkill id to substitute if this one fails
            (RFC §8.3 replanning ladder). HF Hub shape.
        benchmarks: Map of canonical benchmark suite id → success rate
            (``[0.0, 1.0]``) as measured for this skill. Keys
            constrained to :data:`BenchmarkName`. The full per-task
            breakdown lives in the matching
            ``rskills/<id>/eval/<key>.json`` validated against
            :class:`RSkillEvalResult`.
        evaluated_tasks: Benchmark task ids / families this checkpoint was
            trained or validated for (e.g. ``["libero_spatial"]`` covering
            ``libero_spatial/0..9``, or ``["maniskill3/PickCube-v1"]``). The
            benchmark runner gates a scene's ``task.id`` against this list: a
            non-empty list that does not cover the scene's task is refused with
            :class:`ROSCapabilityMismatch` (prevents running a checkpoint on a
            task it was not trained for — e.g. a LiftCube policy on PickCube).
            Empty (default) is permissive: legacy rSkills run with a warning.
            Matching: exact ``task.id``, a ``"<scene>/<...>"`` prefix family,
            or the bare ``scene.id``. See ADR-0060.
        sim_env_control_mode: Optional simulator controller mode this policy
            expects the env to run in, when the scene itself does not pin one.
            Currently consumed by the LIBERO backend (``"relative"`` = OSC
            delta-EE, the default for SmolVLA / π0.5 / rldx1 / molmoact2 /
            GR00T; ``"absolute"`` = OSC absolute-EE, required by xVLA which
            emits absolute end-effector targets). Lets an absolute-control
            policy run on the canonical ``libero_spatial.yaml`` without a
            duplicate per-policy scene; ``scene.backend_options.control_mode``
            still overrides it. ``None`` (default) → backend default.
        policy_extras: Adapter-owned runtime knobs copied from the rSkill
            manifest into :class:`VLASpec.extra` during CLI composition.
            Used for family-specific generation, sampling, replay, or
            transform settings that are part of the checkpoint contract but
            should not become top-level manifest schema fields.
        paper_url: Canonical paper URL for this skill / family.
        dataset_uri: HF Hub URI for the training dataset.
        source_repo: HF Hub URI for the upstream weights repo (often
            the same as :attr:`weights_uri`'s prefix).

            the skill does (objects, scenes, task type), not how it was
            trained.
        actions: REQUIRED. Closed-vocabulary list (≥1) of high-level
            action verbs this skill performs (see :class:`RSkillAction`).
            Generalist / foundation checkpoints declare ``[GENERALIST]``;
            specialist checkpoints list the verbs they were trained on
            (e.g. ``[PICK, PLACE]``). Surfaced to the reasoner LLM
            alongside :attr:`description` so it can pick the right skill
            for a given goal.
        objects: Optional free-form keywords for the objects this skill
            manipulates (e.g. ``["cube"]``, ``["pipe"]``, ``["drawer"]``).
            Discriminative hints for the LLM; the long tail (RoboCasa-365
            has hundreds of categories) makes a closed enum impractical.
        scenes: Optional free-form keywords for the scenes / environments
            this skill targets (e.g. ``["tabletop"]``, ``["kitchen"]``).
            Same rationale as :attr:`objects`.
        processors: Per-file URIs for the lerobot ``PolicyProcessorPipeline``
            artefacts (Gap 1 + Gap 3 of the rSkill self-containment audit).
            REQUIRED when ``model_family`` is one of ``smolvla``, ``pi05``,
            ``xvla``, ``diffusion``, or ``rldx``; OPTIONAL for ``act`` (the
            legacy norm-stats-in-safetensors path is allowed there).
        image_preprocessing: Per-checkpoint image-side knobs that cannot be
            encoded in the processor JSONs (flip, camera renames).
            Optional; ``None`` means schema defaults apply.
        state_contract: Per-checkpoint proprioception layout (named layouts
            for RoboCasa; explicit ``dim`` for everything else).
        action_contract: Per-checkpoint action vector contract (dim +
            optional representation). ADR-0019: consumed by the dataset
            bridge to bind the LeRobot v3 ``action`` feature shape
            without consulting the runtime adapter.
        n_action_steps: Replay cadence (how many actions to consume from a
            chunk before re-inferring). Omit when equal to ``chunk_size``;
            the adapter falls through to its family default.

      ``"PnPCounterToCab"``). Set :attr:`prebuilt_task`; leave all

    scene.backend_options)``. The parent ``SceneSpec.backend_options:

        spawn_objects: Subset of RoboCasa object asset names to spawn on

        robots: RoboCasa robot composition names, e.g.

class TaskSpec(BaseModel):
    """A task declaration — WHAT the robot must achieve inside a scene.

    Tasks decouple scene assets (``SceneSpec``) from goal-conditioning. The
    same scene can host many tasks; the same task can occasionally be run in
    multiple compatible scenes (rare; usually 1:1 with ``scene_id``).

    Success is evaluated by the scene adapter — the reward / success signal
    comes from the underlying gym env (``info['is_success']``,
    ``info['success']``, terminal reward, …).  ``success_key`` lets manifest
    authors override which info field the runner reads.

    Attributes:
        id: Stable task identifier, e.g. ``"libero_spatial/task_0"``,
            ``"metaworld/push-v3"``.  Adapters split on ``/`` to resolve.
        scene_id: ID of the :class:`SceneSpec` this task runs in.
        instruction: Natural-language goal handed to the VLA as the
            ``"task"`` text input.  Some adapters override this with a
            description baked into the underlying suite (LIBERO, MetaWorld).
        max_steps: Episode budget. Adapters may clip to scene-internal limits.
            ``None`` means unset; ``BenchmarkScene`` enforces a concrete value
            via its model validator.
        success_key: Key inside ``info`` returned by ``env.step()`` whose
            truthy value marks task success. ``None`` means unset;
            :class:`BenchmarkScene` enforces a concrete value via its model
            validator (required for paper-comparison benchmarks).

            ``"xvla"``, ``"random"``, ``"zero"``. Picks the loader.

        device: Torch device override. ``"auto"`` picks ``cuda:0`` if

            default" (e.g. an URDF's identity placement). Only honoured by

# ─── Standalone protocol descriptor (eval suites are bare lists now) ─────────
#
# ADR-0009 originally split the "eval" responsibility into two named
# subsystems:
#   * SimEnvironment (above) — free-axis single rollouts. Every axis is a
#     field on the spec; the user composes the rollout they want.
#   * BenchmarkSpec — a Pydantic wrapper around a list of BenchmarkScenes
#     pinning a fixed (robot x scenes x tasks x protocol); only the VLA
#     varied. Loaded from ``benchmarks/<id>.yaml`` via
#     ``BenchmarkSpec.from_yaml``.
#
# ADR-0042 (June 2026) deleted the wrapper. A benchmark suite is now a
# bare ``list[BenchmarkScene]`` on disk and in memory; the suite-id is
# the filename stem. Load via :func:`openral_core.load_benchmark_suite`
# and validate the suite-level invariants (uniformity of robot_id,
# n_episodes, seed, metadata; unique task ids; non-empty list) via
# :func:`openral_core.raise_on_invalid_suite`. The output is still a
# validated :class:`RSkillEvalResult` JSON dropped into
# ``rskills/<vla>/eval/<benchmark_id>.json`` with
# ``reproduced_locally=true``.
#
# Task 10 of ADR-0041 (the precursor to ADR-0042) had already flattened
# the per-scene payload: each entry carries its own ``robot_id``, ``task``,
# ``n_episodes``, ``seed``, and :class:`BenchmarkMetadata` block.
# :class:`ProtocolSpec` survives as a standalone schema for ADR drafts
# and benchmark-report tooling that wants to describe a protocol outside
# a suite context.


class ProtocolSpec(BaseModel):
    """Stand-alone eval-protocol descriptor.

    Historically the ``protocol`` block on the deleted ``BenchmarkSpec``
    (ADR-0009). After the Task-10 scene-hierarchy convergence (ADR-0041,
    June 2026) a benchmark became a list of :class:`BenchmarkScene`s —
    each scene carries its own ``n_episodes`` / ``seed`` /
    ``task.success_key`` / ``task.max_steps`` — and ADR-0042 then
    deleted the ``BenchmarkSpec`` wrapper altogether. ``ProtocolSpec``
    is retained as a public schema for callers that want to describe a
    protocol independently (e.g. ADR drafts, benchmark-report tooling).

    Pins the methodology so two rSkills evaluated under the same benchmark
    produce apples-to-apples numbers. Authors of a benchmark should set
    these to match the published protocol of the suite they are reproducing
    (e.g. LIBERO: 10 episodes per task, fixed seed range, ``is_success``).

    Attributes:
        n_episodes: Number of independent episodes per task. Honest
            success rates need >= 10 per task for the published LIBERO /
            MetaWorld protocols.
        seeds: Seed list applied per task (paired index-wise with the
            episode index). Length MUST be >= ``n_episodes``; runners
            slice ``seeds[:n_episodes]`` so re-runs are reproducible.
        success_key: ``info`` key on the gym ``step()`` return whose truthy
            value marks task success. Default ``"is_success"`` (LIBERO
            convention); MetaWorld uses ``"success"``.
        max_steps: Per-task episode budget. Adapters may clip to
            scene-internal limits; the value here is the protocol ceiling.
        min_reps: Minimum number of completed episodes per task before the
            result JSON is written. Guards against a crash mid-suite
            producing a misleadingly partial roll-up. ``None`` means

    emits an ordered list of finer subtasks and the node applies it to the
    deterministic :class:`MissionState`, replacing the free-form-JSON gap with
    structured output (CLAUDE.md §3). Two modes, selected by ``target_task_id``:

    * **populate** (``target_task_id`` empty) — build a fresh mission queue from
      ``subtasks``, refining the single-task seed when the operator goal needs a
      finer decomposition than a single prompt.
    * **subdivide** (``target_task_id`` set) — *flat-splice* the named blocked
      task in place with ``subtasks`` (``t2 → t2.1, t2.2``), bounded by
      :data:`~openral_reasoner.mission.DEFAULT_MAX_SUBDIVIDE_DEPTH`; past the
      bound the node hands off instead.

    ADR-0075: each subtask is a :class:`GroundedSubtask` (one specific object),

:class:`DecomposeMissionTool` — the typed path for the ``decompose-mission``
playbook to write/refine the deterministic :class:`MissionState` task queue
(populate or flat-splice a blocked task); it edits only the S2 ledger, never
actuation. Extending the palette requires (a) a new variant here, (b) the
corresponding ROS-side dispatch in ``openral_reasoner_ros.reasoner_node``, (c) a
CLAUDE.md §6.2 / §7.6 amendment if the new tool shifts the reasoner's authority
