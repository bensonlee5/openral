"""``RobotDescription`` → LeRobot v3 ``features`` dict mapping.

A LeRobot v3.0 dataset writer needs a ``features`` schema dict at
construction time describing every column in the on-disk Parquet +
the codec/shape for every video stream. Building that dict by hand is
error-prone: the state vector shape comes from
``RobotDescription.observation_spec.state_shape``, the action dim from
``RobotDescription.action_spec.dim``, and every per-camera video key
from the ``SensorSpec.vla_feature_key`` of every sensor whose modality
is an image / depth stream.

This module exposes one pure function — :func:`features_from_robot` —
that does that mapping. It has no I/O and no lerobot dependency, which
keeps :class:`openral_dataset.LeRobotDatasetSink` testable on hosts
without lerobot installed (the sink lazy-imports lerobot; this
function does not import lerobot at all).

    Args:
        robot: Normative robot description. ``observation_spec.state_shape``
            and ``action_spec.dim`` are consulted when present; when absent
            or empty (the typical pre-spec robot in the catalogue,
            e.g. Franka, GR1, Sawyer, etc., where the sim-specific
            contract lives on the rSkill manifest or the scene adapter),
            the caller MUST supply ``state_shape_override`` /
            ``action_dim_override``. Sensors with image modalities and a
            ``vla_feature_key`` always contribute per-camera video features.
        fps: Recording cadence in Hz; carried alongside the feature dict
            into ``meta/info.json["fps"]`` by the sink. Validated here
            so the sink doesn't have to repeat it.
        state_shape_override: Shape of the proprioception vector when
            the robot's ``observation_spec`` is missing or empty.
            Resolved from the first frame by the sink in the typical
            sim path (see :class:`LeRobotDatasetSink._create_dataset`).
        action_dim_override: Dimensionality of the action vector when
            the robot's ``action_spec`` is missing. Same fallback story
            as ``state_shape_override``.
        camera_shape_override: Uniform ``(height, width)`` override for
            every camera-bearing sensor's feature shape. Used by the
            sim CLI to thread ``SceneSpec.observation_height/width``
            (sim renders all cameras at one scene-level resolution
            that often differs from the physical sensor's intrinsics).
            When ``None``, each camera's shape comes from its
            ``SensorSpec.intrinsics.{width,height}``.

    Returns:
        Mapping from feature name (e.g. ``"observation.state"``) to
        :class:`FeatureSpec`. Always contains the canonical
        bookkeeping features (``next.reward``, ``next.done``,
        ``next.success``, ``next.terminated``, ``next.truncated``) so
        sinks can write them unconditionally.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``fps <= 0`` or neither the robot's spec nor an
            override provides a usable state/action shape.
