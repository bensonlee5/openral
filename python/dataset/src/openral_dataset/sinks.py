"""LeRobotDatasetSink — writes LeRobot v3.0 datasets from RolloutRecorder fan-out.

Wraps :class:`lerobot.datasets.LeRobotDataset` (codebase_version ``"3.0"``,
shipped in ``lerobot>=0.5.1``). The sink:

* Lazy-imports lerobot at construction so the package stays importable on
  hosts without lerobot. A typed :class:`ROSConfigError` with the install
  hint is raised the moment ``LeRobotDatasetSink`` is instantiated without
  lerobot in the environment.
* Defers ``LeRobotDataset.create()`` until the first :meth:`write_frame`
  call so the per-camera video shapes can be taken from the actual frame
  (sim and hardware often render at runtime-determined resolutions; the
  ``SensorSpec.intrinsics`` field is optional in the RobotDescription
  schema and not always populated).
* Carries the per-dataset license + repo_id into
  ``meta/info.json["metadata"]`` so downstream consumers can read it
  without consulting an out-of-band metadata table.
* Aggregates a per-dataset ``dataset_success_rate`` across all episodes
  so consumers can filter to successful rollouts without a full pass
  over the rows.

Per CLAUDE.md §1.11 (no mocks) — tests instantiate this sink and exercise
a real :class:`lerobot.datasets.LeRobotDataset` round-trip on hosts where
lerobot is installed; on hosts without lerobot the tests
``pytest.skip`` with the install hint.

        vcodec: ffmpeg codec for the video streams (default
            ``"libsvtav1"`` — lerobot's v3 default).

            camera_shape: Override for every camera feature's

                ``SceneSpec.observation_height/width`` (sim renders all
                cameras at one scene-level resolution that often
                differs from the physical sensor's intrinsics — pi05's
