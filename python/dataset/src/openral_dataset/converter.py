"""Rosbag2ToLeRobotConverter — offline mcap rosbag2 → LeRobotDataset v3.

Reads back the mcap file written by :class:`Rosbag2Sink`
(PR3) and produces a :class:`lerobot.datasets.LeRobotDataset` v3.0 via
the same :class:`LeRobotDatasetSink` the online sim path uses. Closes
the bidirectional bridge: hardware execution → mcap bag → on-disk
LeRobotDataset → HF Hub via `openral dataset push` (PR5).

The converter is deliberately narrow:

* Reads only the two openral topics (`/openral/tick`, `/openral/episode`).
  Camera streams on `/cameras/<id>/image_raw` are NOT joined in this PR;
  PR3 records zero-placeholder images in the bag (the hardware path's
  inline data isn't available without ROS), and PR2's `SensorRosPublisher`
  writes the real camera frames to ROS topics that this converter will
  read in a follow-up. The current converter therefore produces
  state-and-action-only datasets — every camera key in the robot's
  ``features_from_robot`` output gets a zero-shape video. That is
  honest: there are no real images in the bag to recover.

* Walks `/openral/episode` markers to segment the bag into discrete
  episodes. A bag with no Episode markers is rejected with a clean
  :class:`ROSConfigError` — the converter is not in the business of
  guessing where one episode ends and the next begins.

* Joins state + action at the recorded timestamps. mcap iter_messages
  is time-ordered; the converter zips Ticks with the preceding /
  trailing Episode markers into one episode per (PHASE_START,
  PHASE_END) pair.

Per CLAUDE.md §1.11 — exercised in `python/dataset/tests/test_converter.py`
against real bags written by the PR3 sink, with the resulting dataset
reloaded by a real :class:`lerobot.datasets.LeRobotDataset` reader.
