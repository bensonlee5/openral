"""Tests for ``openral_dataset.schema_map.features_from_robot``.

Per CLAUDE.md §1.11: loads real ``RobotDescription`` manifests from
``robots/*/robot.yaml``. No mocks, no synthetic robots.

The SO-100 tests cover the happy path (a robot with full
observation_spec + action_spec + 2 cameras). The parametrized
``test_every_robot_manifest_*`` cases sweep every
``robots/*/robot.yaml`` in the repo to catch schema drift on the other
10 manifests (Aloha bimanual, Franka Panda, UR5e/UR10e, PushT,
Sawyer, GR1, WidowX, Google Robot, Panda Mobile). Robots without
observation_spec / action_spec MUST raise a typed ValueError with an
actionable message — the converter relies on this for clean
diagnostics.
