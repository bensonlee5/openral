"""SafetyClient stub.

The :class:`SafetyClient` Protocol is the seam the inference runner calls
just before :meth:`HAL.send_action`. The real implementation will be the
C++ safety kernel — a separate, certifiable process (CLAUDE.md §6 Layer 6,
``packages/safety/`` planned). This module ships only the Python-side
Protocol + a no-op default so PRs F+ can compose against a locked
signature, and every tick already emits a ``safety.check`` span via
:func:`~openral_observability.safety_span`.

Contract:

* :meth:`SafetyClient.check_action` returns ``None`` when the proposed
  :class:`~openral_core.Action` passes; the runner then forwards it
  to the HAL.
* On rejection, :meth:`check_action` raises
  :class:`~openral_core.exceptions.ROSSafetyViolation` (or a
  subclass such as :class:`ROSWorkspaceViolation`,
  :class:`ROSForceLimitExceeded`, :class:`ROSEStopRequested`). Per
  CLAUDE.md §10 the exception is **never** silently caught; the runner
  catches at its supervisor boundary (M6 / PR F :class:`DeployRunner`),
  records the violation into :attr:`TickResult.safety_violations`,
  flips :attr:`TickResult.action_applied` to ``False``, and propagates
  for E-stop handling.

This module intentionally does NOT implement bounds-checking against a
:class:`SafetyEnvelope` (force / velocity / workspace AABB / etc.) —
that logic belongs in the C++ kernel and porting it would create a
divergent Python-side enforcer. The stub keeps the seam wired so the
real client lands as a drop-in replacement.

    Useful for digital-twin runs and pre-hardware integration tests where
    the C++ safety kernel is not wired yet. Every :meth:`check_action`
    call opens a ``safety.check`` span with ``severity="info"`` so traces
    still show the safety seam was exercised — distinguishing "runner
