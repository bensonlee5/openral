"""Inference runner Protocol.

The :class:`InferenceRunner` Protocol is the contract every runner shape
satisfies — today the sim path (``openral_sim``-backed shim, future PR)
and the hardware path (``openral_runner.deploy_runner.DeployRunner``,
PR F). The Protocol is intentionally narrow so subclasses or shims only
have to honour ``activate / tick / run / deactivate``; everything else
(rate-limited loop, OTel parent span, latency budget enforcement) lives
in :class:`openral_runner.base.InferenceRunnerBase`.

See the OpenRAL architecture docs for the full design.
