"""GStreamer pipeline-string builder + platform detection.

This module is import-safe on hosts without GStreamer or PyGObject: it
does **not** import ``gi`` at module load. All it does is

1. Detect what kind of NVIDIA platform we are on
   (:class:`Platform`) by reading ``/etc/nv_tegra_release`` and
   probing ``gst-inspect-1.0`` for the presence of specific elements
   (``nvarguscamerasrc`` on Tegra, ``nvh264dec`` on desktop NVIDIA).
2. Build a GStreamer pipeline string from a typed
   :class:`PipelineSpec`, selecting the right source / decoder /
   format-converter elements for the detected platform.
3. Ensure the trailing ``appsink`` element carries a known name
   (default ``bh_sink``) so the reader can fetch it via
   ``Gst.Bin.get_by_name``.

The output is fed verbatim to ``Gst.parse_launch`` inside the reader
(commit #2 of ADR-0010 PR I). Keeping the builder a pure-Python
string transformer means every code path can be unit-tested on
stock Ubuntu without NVIDIA plugins or PyGObject.

    HEVC, ``nvvidconv`` for NVMM-aware colour conversion. Buffers
    flow in ``video/x-raw(memory:NVMM)`` caps and can be lifted to
    CUDA zero-copy via ``libnvbufsurface.so``.

    ``NVIDIA_DEEPSTREAM`` is x86_64 with a full DeepStream install —
    the opt-in ``ds-on`` (DS9) image (``docker/inference/Dockerfile.x86``,
    ``WITH_DEEPSTREAM_STAGE=on``, shipped as
    ``openral:x86-deepstream-latest``). Detected by the presence of
    **both** ``nvjpegdec`` and ``nvvideoconvert``. On this tier the main
    reader pipeline is NVMM-native (ADR-0082): ``nvjpegdec`` decodes
    MJPG **directly into** ``video/x-raw(memory:NVMM)`` (the decoded
    frame is born in GPU memory; only the compressed JPEG crosses PCIe)
    and ``nvvideoconvert`` colour-converts on-GPU, so the appsink

    ``NVIDIA_DESKTOP`` is x86_64 with an NVIDIA GPU and the

    (``nvh264dec``, ``nvh264enc``, …) and ``cudaupload`` /
    ``cudadownload``, but not ``nvvideoconvert``. The pipeline builder
    (``_build_convert``) falls back to stock ``videoconvert`` on this
    branch; the GPU path covers decode/encode only, and no element in
    the reader pipeline produces ``memory:NVMM`` caps.

    ``CPU_ONLY`` is the fallback: stock GStreamer plugins, no
    NVIDIA-specific elements. Frames flow in system memory; the

    directly the string is passed through (with the appsink name
    ensured); when the YAML supplies ``source / device / ...`` we
    materialise a :class:`PipelineSpec` and build the string here.

    Args:
        source: The upstream element family (see :class:`Source`).
        device: Source-specific device locator. ``int`` for v4l2 device
            indices, ``str`` for paths (``/dev/video0``, ``/path/to/file.mp4``,
            ``rtsp://...``, etc.). Ignored when ``source == TESTSRC``.

            element pick its default.
        height: Negotiated frame height in pixels. ``None`` lets the source
            element pick its default.
        fps: Capture / framerate hint forwarded to the source.
        encoded: ``True`` when the upstream stream is compressed
            (H.264 / HEVC, e.g. typical USB-UVC H.264 or RTSP). Drives
            decoder selection.
        jpeg: ``True`` when the USB camera delivers MJPG (the common
            UVC compressed mode; e.g. the icspring wrist cam exposes no
            raw modes at all). Inserts an ``image/jpeg`` capsfilter +
            JPEG decoder after ``v4l2src``: ``nvjpegdec`` on
            :attr:`Platform.NVIDIA_DEEPSTREAM` (decodes straight into
            NVMM — ADR-0082), stock ``jpegdec`` elsewhere. USB source
            only; mutually exclusive with ``encoded``.
        enable_nvmm: Hint to keep frames in ``memory:NVMM`` caps for
            NVMM→CUDA handoff. Honored only when the platform is
            :attr:`Platform.TEGRA` or :attr:`Platform.NVIDIA_DESKTOP`.
        enable_ros_tee: When ``True``, the builder inserts a ``tee`` so
            a second branch can feed a ROS 2 publisher (commit #4).
        enable_event_tee: When ``True``, the builder adds a third
            ``tee`` branch terminating in ``event_appsink_name``. The
            event branch lifts frames to system memory and rate-limits
            via ``videorate`` to :attr:`event_rate_hz`; the
            :class:`PerceptionEventPublisher` (ADR-0018 F6) runs
            detectors on its samples and publishes
            ``PromptStamped`` on ``/openral/perception/<kind>``. Policy

            singleton, per ADR-0011 §"Shared CUDA context".
        appsink_name: Name attached to the openral appsink for
            ``Gst.Bin.get_by_name``. Defaults to ``bh_sink``.
        ros_appsink_name: Name attached to the ROS-side appsink (when

            ``enable_event_tee`` is ``True``). Defaults to
            ``event_sink``.
        event_rate_hz: Maximum framerate on the event branch in Hz. The
            event leg is for vision events (motion, scene change,
            objects, OCR) and runs at a fraction of the policy rate so
            CPU detectors keep up. Defaults to 5 Hz, matching the
            reasoner tick rate.
        max_buffers: ``max-buffers`` property on the appsink. The reader
            wants ``1`` (latest-only) but tests with finite
            ``num-buffers`` may set higher to avoid drop messages.
