"""Runtime tee-branch manager for the GStreamer perception bus.

A :class:`TeeManager` owns the named ``tee`` of a *running* camera pipeline
(:data:`~openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.pipeline.TEE_NAME`) and attaches /
detaches consumer branches on the live pipeline via dynamic pad add / remove.
This is the mechanism the S2 reasoner drives through ``ExecuteSkill``: activating
a detector rSkill attaches a branch; deactivating it detaches the branch.

Each branch is built as ``<leaky queue> ! <caller elements>`` so a stalled or
crashing consumer drops its own frames instead of backpressuring the policy leg
— the same leaky-branch isolation policy the static pipeline builder applies
via :func:`~openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.pipeline.leaky_branch`, shared here
through :data:`~openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.pipeline.LEAKY_BRANCH_QUEUE`.

Lifecycle:

* :meth:`attach` requests a ``tee`` src pad, parses the branch into a bin, adds
  it to the pipeline, links the pad, and syncs the branch to PLAYING. Adding is
  safe on a live tee — the leaky queue absorbs the brief pre-roll window.
* :meth:`detach` installs an ``IDLE`` pad probe on the branch's ``tee`` pad; when
  the pad next goes idle (between buffers, on the streaming thread) the probe
  unlinks the branch, releases the request pad, and tears the bin down to
  ``NULL``. This is the canonical safe-detach pattern for a flowing pipeline.

Like :mod:`~openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.reader`, this module imports
``gi`` at load and therefore requires the ``gstreamer`` optional-extra; the
:mod:`~openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.pipeline` builder it depends on is
import-safe everywhere.
