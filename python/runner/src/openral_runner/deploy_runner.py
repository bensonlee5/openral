"""Hardware inference runner.

:class:`DeployRunner` is the first concrete subclass of
:class:`~openral_runner.InferenceRunnerBase` and closes the
inference loop end-to-end on real hardware (or a digital twin):

::

    for each tick at rate_hz:
        for each SensorReader:
            frame = reader.read_latest()
            aggregator.update_image(frame.sensor_id, frame.topic, frame.stamp_wall_ns)
        aggregator.update_joint_state(hal.read_state())
        snapshot = aggregator.snapshot()
        action = skill.step(snapshot)
        try:
            safety_client.check_action(action)        # CLAUDE.md §10
            hal.send_action(action)
        except ROSSafetyViolation as exc:
            record on TickResult.safety_violations
            do NOT call hal.send_action — set action_applied=False

The runner does not manage the :class:`~openral_rskill.Skill`
lifecycle: callers must :meth:`Skill.configure` + :meth:`Skill.activate`
before constructing the runner. The runner does manage HAL connection
and SensorReader open/close as part of its own
:meth:`activate` / :meth:`deactivate`.

In-process image frames flow through the inference hot path
unchanged (``SensorReader.read_latest()`` → ``WorldState.image_frames``
via the aggregator). When a host needs the same frames on a ROS topic
— for the rosbag2 recorder, Foxglove, or
``rqt_image_view`` — :class:`openral_sensors.ros_publisher.SensorRosPublisher`
runs as a *parallel* consumer of the same reader from its own thread.
The GStreamer backend additionally provides a zero-copy tee via
:class:`openral_runner.backends.gstreamer.ros_tee.RosImagePublisher`;
the sensors-side publisher is the universal-but-copying fallback for
OpenCV / RealSense / mock readers.

    """Compose HAL + Skill + WorldStateAggregator + SensorReaders + SafetyClient.

    Mirrors the simulator runner (``openral_sim.SimRunner``) but
    drives real hardware via a :class:`HAL` adapter instead of a sim env.
    Subclass of :class:`InferenceRunnerBase` so the rate-limited loop,
    ``rskill.tick`` OTel parent span, and :class:`RunResult` aggregation
    come for free.

    The runner is the safety-supervisor boundary for the inference loop
    (CLAUDE.md §10): when :meth:`SafetyClient.check_action` raises
    :class:`ROSSafetyViolation`, the runner records the violation on the
    :class:`TickResult` and skips the :meth:`HAL.send_action` call; the
    exception is **not** re-raised because the runner already mitigated
    by withholding the action. Future PRs hook this into the real
    E-stop / incident-log path when the C++ safety kernel lands.

    Args:
        hal: A :class:`~openral_hal.protocol.HAL` adapter. The runner
            calls :meth:`HAL.connect` in :meth:`activate` and
            :meth:`HAL.disconnect` in :meth:`deactivate`.
        skill: A :class:`~openral_rskill.Skill` instance that is
            **already configured + activated**. The runner does not
            re-load weights (that is the caller's responsibility — weight
            loading is heavy and not idempotent).
        aggregator: The :class:`WorldStateAggregator` instance the runner
            feeds joint state + sensor topic refs into each tick.
        sensor_readers: Sequence of :class:`SensorReader` instances. The
            runner opens each in :meth:`activate` and closes in
            :meth:`deactivate`. Frames whose carry-mode is ``topic`` are
            forwarded to :meth:`WorldStateAggregator.update_image`; frames
            carrying inline ``data`` or ``handle`` are noted but not yet
            attached to the snapshot (follow-up).
        safety_client: Optional :class:`SafetyClient`. Defaults to a
            :class:`NullSafetyClient` so digital-twin runs still emit
            ``safety.check`` spans even without the C++ kernel.
        **base_kwargs: Forwarded to
            :class:`InferenceRunnerBase.__init__` (``rate_hz``,
            ``deadline_overrun_policy``, ``runner_name``,
            ``latency_budget_ms``, ``save_dir``).
