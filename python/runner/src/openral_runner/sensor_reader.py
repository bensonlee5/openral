"""SensorReader Protocol.

The :class:`SensorReader` Protocol is the seam between a sensor's physical
capture backend (OpenCV / ROS image topic / GStreamer pipeline) and the
inference runner. Each tick the runner asks every configured reader for
its freshest frame; the reader returns a :class:`SensorFrame` whose
``data | topic | handle`` carry-mode reflects the backend's transport.

The Protocol is intentionally narrow: ``open / close / read_latest``.
``open`` may start background capture threads or pipelines; ``close`` is
idempotent. ``read_latest`` is non-blocking — it returns the most recent
frame the backend has buffered, or raises
:class:`~openral_core.exceptions.ROSPerceptionStale` when the
freshest frame is older than the caller's ``max_age_ms`` budget.

See the OpenRAL architecture docs for the SensorReader design.
