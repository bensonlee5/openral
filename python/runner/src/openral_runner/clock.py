"""High-precision cadence helpers for the inference runner.

The :class:`~openral_runner.InferenceRunner` foreground loop ticks at
the runner rate (default 30 Hz to match
:class:`~openral_world_state.WorldStateAggregator`). To hit that cadence
on hosts where ``time.sleep`` has ~1-2 ms jitter, the runner uses
:func:`precise_sleep` — a hybrid that delegates the bulk of the wait to
``time.sleep`` and then busy-waits the final millisecond on
``time.perf_counter()``. This is the same shape lerobot uses in
``src/lerobot/scripts/lerobot_record.py:record_loop``.

The helper is intentionally tiny; the runner's PR C deadline-overrun policy
(``warn`` / ``drop`` / ``raise``) is applied separately around it.
