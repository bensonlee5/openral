"""Built-in lookup indices used by the assembler.

Two small registries:

- :func:`canonical_robot_path` — given a ``bh_robot_type`` produced by
  ``openral_cli.autodetect`` (USB VID/PID match or DDS topic-prefix
  inference), return the path to the canonical ``robots/<name>/robot.yaml``.
  Used by the assembler so that **standard rigs** (SO-100, ALOHA, Unitree
  G1, …) get their canonical ``RobotDescription`` directly via
  ``RobotDescription.from_yaml(...)``, with detected sensors and compute
  spliced on top — the assembler never re-synthesises a known robot.

- :func:`signature_for_realsense` / :func:`signature_for_v4l2` /
  :func:`signature_for_usb_uvc` — convenience helpers that build the
  matching :class:`openral_sensors.SensorSignature` for each probe
  output kind.  Centralised here so probes don't import the catalog and
  the assembler doesn't grow ad-hoc helpers.

def canonical_robot_path(bh_robot_type: str) -> Path | None:
    """Resolve a ``bh_robot_type`` slug to a committed ``robots/<name>/robot.yaml``.

    Resolution is two-step: the slug is first translated through
    :data:`_OPENRAL_ROBOT_TYPE_TO_DIR` (``"so100"`` → ``"so100_follower"``);
    if it is not a known alias the slug is tried **verbatim** as a
    ``robots/<slug>/`` directory name. The second step lets an explicit
    ``openral detect --robot <name>`` override target any committed robot by
    its canonical directory name (e.g. ``"so101_follower"``) without first
    teaching the VID/PID table about it.

    Args:
        bh_robot_type: Slug as produced by
            ``openral_cli.autodetect.match_known_devices`` (USB VID/PID)
            or ``infer_robot_from_topics`` (DDS topic-prefix), or a canonical
            ``robots/<name>`` directory name passed via an operator override.

    Returns:
        Path to the canonical manifest if the slug resolves (via alias or
        directly) **and** the file exists on disk; ``None`` otherwise (e.g.
        for ``"unknown"``, for an unfamiliar slug, or when the workspace tree
        is absent at runtime).

    Example:
        >>> from openral_detect.registry import canonical_robot_path
        >>> p = canonical_robot_path("so100")
        >>> p is None or p.name == "robot.yaml"
        True
        >>> # Canonical directory name resolves directly (no alias needed):
        >>> q = canonical_robot_path("so101_follower")
