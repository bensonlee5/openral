# openral-observability

OpenRAL observability — OpenTelemetry tracing + structlog→OTLP logging bridge for Skill / inference / safety spans

Part of [**OpenRAL**](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral) — the open Robot
Abstraction Layer for vision-language-action robotics. This package is one
member of the OpenRAL Python workspace; see the architecture overview and the
eight-layer model in the project docs.

## Voice prompt (local speech-to-text)

The live dashboard's operator-prompt box has a mic button. Click it and the
browser listens until you stop speaking — voice-activity detection runs
client-side via [`@ricky0123/vad-web`](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad)
(Silero VAD). The captured audio is POSTed to `POST /api/transcribe`, which
runs a **local** [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
model on the host, fills the prompt box with the transcript, and sends it via
the normal `/api/prompt` path. Your audio never leaves the machine.

**It works fully offline, out of the box.** `faster-whisper` ships with the
`dashboard` extra (which `openral-cli` already pulls in), and every browser
asset — the VAD library, Silero model, `onnxruntime-web` and its wasm — is
vendored under `static/vendor/vad/`. No CDN, no opt-in extra, no network at
runtime. The endpoint still degrades to HTTP 503 if `faster-whisper` is ever
stripped from the environment, but a normal install never hits that path. The
only one-time cost is the Whisper model weights, fetched from the Hugging Face
Hub on the first transcription and then cached (pre-pull to stay air-gapped).

Tuning knobs (read at first transcription; defaults run on any CPU):

| Env var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENRAL_STT_MODEL` | `base.en` | any faster-whisper model id (`tiny.en`, `small`, `large-v3`, …) |
| `OPENRAL_STT_DEVICE` | `cpu` | `cuda` to use a local GPU |
| `OPENRAL_STT_COMPUTE` | `int8` | CTranslate2 compute type (`int8`, `float16`, …) |

The vendored browser assets and their versions/licenses are documented in
[`static/vendor/vad/NOTICE.md`](src/openral_observability/dashboard/static/vendor/vad/NOTICE.md),
which also records the `npm pack` command to refresh them.

## Live camera video (MJPEG stream)

The camera cards in the dashboard now show live video instead of a static
thumbnail. Each camera is served at:

```
GET /api/camera/{source}/stream
```

This endpoint re-serves the per-camera OTLP thumbnail JPEG as a continuous
`multipart/x-mixed-replace` MJPEG stream — the same thumbnails that already
flow in via the `sensors.read_latest` span attribute `thumbnail_jpeg_b64`. No
extra camera pipeline is needed. The frame rate is bounded by how often the
workload exports spans (configured via `OPENRAL_OTEL_SPAN_SCHEDULE_DELAY_MS`,
default 30 ms ≈ 33 Hz). The endpoint returns 404 only when the source name is
entirely unknown to the store; a known camera that has not yet emitted a frame
opens the stream and waits.

## mDNS discovery (`mdns` extra)

Install the optional `mdns` extra to let `openral dashboard` advertise itself
on the LAN and browse for other OpenRAL services:

```
pip install openral-observability[mdns]
# or, inside the OpenRAL workspace:
uv sync --group mdns
```

This pulls in [`zeroconf>=0.131`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf)
(LGPL-2.1, TSC-approved 2026-06-21; used unmodified as an optional declared
dependency, not vendored).

When `zeroconf` is importable, `run_dashboard` starts a `Discovery` instance
that:

- **Browses** for `_openral-otlp._tcp.local.` services on the LAN (always).
- **Advertises** the dashboard's own OTLP endpoint on the LAN — but **only
  when the bind address is a non-loopback, non-wildcard IPv4 address**. A
  loopback (`127.0.0.1`) or wildcard (`0.0.0.0`) bind is browse-only and never
  advertised (advertising a loopback address to the LAN is meaningless, and
  advertising a wildcard address is ambiguous).

Discovered services are surfaced in the "Add Robot" panel via a read-only
endpoint:

```
GET /api/robots
→ {"enabled": true, "robots": [{name, addresses, port, properties, last_seen}, …]}
```

When the `mdns` extra is absent or `zeroconf` fails to start, the endpoint
returns `{"enabled": false, "robots": []}` — the dashboard runs exactly as
before; discovery is additive, never load-bearing.

## Write-controls (`OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_WRITE_CONTROLS`)

> **Default: OFF.** These endpoints are pending safety-WG review and a
> hazard-log update (ADR-0084). Do not enable in production until the safety WG
> has signed off.

Two guarded write endpoints are available when the flag is set:

```
POST /api/skill/execute   # dispatch an ExecuteRskill action goal (returns 202 on acceptance)
POST /api/param/set       # tune a non-safety ROS 2 parameter via ros2 param set
```

`POST /api/skill/execute` returns **HTTP 202** as soon as the action server
accepts the goal — it does **not** block on skill completion. The response body
includes `goal_id` for telemetry correlation. Execution progress is tracked via
the dashboard SSE stream and OTLP telemetry. The acceptance timeout is
configurable via `OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_SKILL_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT_S` (default `12` s).

Enable them by starting the dashboard with the environment variable set:

```bash
OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_WRITE_CONTROLS=1 openral dashboard
```

The dashboard prints a loud `WARNING:` banner to stderr on startup when the
flag is on. The flag is also surfaced in `GET /api/config`:

```json
{"jaeger_ui_url": "...", "write_controls_enabled": true}
```

**Safety posture (ADR-0084):**

- Both endpoints return `403` when the flag is off (default).
- `POST /api/param/set` also refuses any param name that matches a substring in
  a hard-coded safety denylist (`velocity`, `accel`, `force`, `torque`,
  `limit`, `workspace`, `estop`, `e_stop`, `deadman`, `dead_man`, `safety`,
  `safe`, `watchdog`) — these must be changed via a reviewed config or manifest,
  never the dashboard (CLAUDE.md §1.1).
- Every attempt (permitted or denied) is audit-logged at WARNING level before
  any subprocess is spawned, providing a paper trail.
- The safety kernel (`cpp/openral_safety_kernel`) remains the sole authority on
  whether a skill action proceeds — the dashboard shells out to
  `ros2 action send_goal /openral/execute_rskill`; the kernel disposes.
