"""Spawn a child ``openral dashboard`` and attach the current process to it.

Inverse of ``openral dashboard --inprocess <cmd>``: there, the *dashboard*
spawns the workload as a child with OTLP env pre-set. Here, the
*workload* spawns the dashboard as a child (e.g. ``openral sim run
--dashboard``) so a user can light up the live pane without juggling
two terminals.

The helper is intentionally tolerant: if the child fails to start or
``/healthz`` never comes up, the workload continues without OTel
attached — convenience must not gate the run.
