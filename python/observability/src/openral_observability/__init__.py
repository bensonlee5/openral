"""openral observability — OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics + structlog log bridge.

Public API:
    configure_observability — idempotent SDK setup (no-op when no endpoint).
    configure_worker_observability — SDK setup + parent-trace attach for a spawned worker.
    shutdown_observability  — drain and shut down providers.
    rskill_span             — span for Skill lifecycle (configure / activate / execute).
    inference_span          — span for one VLA chunk inference (foreground or prefetch).
    reasoner_span           — span for one ReasonerCore.tick.
    safety_span             — span for one safety check.
    cli_command_span        — root span for one ``openral`` CLI invocation.
    traced                  — decorator equivalent of the above context managers.
    semconv                 — single source of truth for attribute / span / metric names.
    metrics                 — pre-registered OTel meter instruments.
    propagation             — W3C ``traceparent`` inject / extract helpers.
    dashboard               — live debugging dashboard (FastAPI + SSE + OTLP/HTTP receiver).

Example:
    >>> from openral_observability import configure_observability, rskill_span
    >>> configure_observability(service_name="ral")
    >>> with rskill_span("rskill.configure", rskill_id="hello"):
    ...     pass
