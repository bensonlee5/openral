"""Layout-adapter registry for per-checkpoint state-vector assembly.

Single mapping from the closed :data:`openral_core.StateLayout` literal

Layout files (one per literal value) register themselves at import via
:func:`register`. The reasoner palette filter and the skill_runner both
consult this registry — when a layout is present, the wrapped-task-space
drop flips to admit-with-adapter.
