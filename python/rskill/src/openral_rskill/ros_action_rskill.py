"""ROS-wrapping rSkill — wraps any ROS 2 action / service as an :class:`rSkillBase`.

Bridges between OpenRAL's :class:`~openral_core.schemas.RSkillManifest` /
:meth:`rSkillBase.step` lifecycle and an arbitrary upstream ROS 2 action
server (MoveIt's :class:`moveit_msgs.action.MoveGroup`, Nav2's
:class:`nav2_msgs.action.NavigateToPose`, …). One adapter, two operating
modes selected by :attr:`RosIntegration.result_trajectory_field`:

* **Trajectory mode** (``result_trajectory_field`` set, e.g. MoveIt):
  on the first :meth:`~rSkillBase.step` call the adapter sends the goal,
  blocks on the result, extracts a
  :class:`trajectory_msgs.msg.JointTrajectory` from the result, reorders
  its joints into the host :class:`RobotDescription`'s joint order, and
  emits one waypoint per subsequent ``step()`` as an
  :class:`~openral_core.schemas.Action` chunk. After the last waypoint
  raises :class:`~openral_core.exceptions.ROSRskillGoalSatisfied`.
* **Result-only mode** (``result_trajectory_field is None``, e.g. Nav2):
  the wrapped action server drives actuators itself (Nav2 publishes
  ``/cmd_vel`` via its behaviour tree). The adapter just awaits the
  result and raises ``ROSRskillGoalSatisfied`` on success on the first
  ``step()`` call.

ROS imports (``rclpy``, the IDL package named in
:attr:`RosIntegration.package`) are deferred to lifecycle hooks so that
schema-level tests and tooling can import this module without an
``ament``-built workspace on ``$PYTHONPATH``.

    The wrapped action (MoveIt) returns a
    :class:`trajectory_msgs.msg.JointTrajectory` whose ``joint_names``
    list orders the per-point ``positions`` array. The
    :class:`~openral_core.schemas.RobotDescription`'s ``joints`` list
    orders the safety supervisor's envelope check and the HAL's wire
    ``ActionChunk``. The two are not guaranteed to match — MoveIt uses
    its ``JointModelGroup`` ordering, which is configuration-driven,
    and the robot description typically carries additional joints the
    planner doesn't move (gripper, head pan, …). Without a reorder
    the supervisor checks the wrong joint against the wrong envelope
    limit (``packages/openral_safety/openral_safety/supervisor_node.py``);
    silently mis-applied joint targets would be a safety-critical bug.

    The wrapped server's joint list MUST be a (non-strict) subset of
    the host's joint list. Slots in ``target_names`` that don't appear
    in ``source_names`` are returned in the second tuple element so
    the caller (typically
    :meth:`ROSActionRskill._dispatch_and_cache_result`) knows which
    slots to backfill from the host's current
    :attr:`~openral_core.schemas.WorldState.joint_state` rather than

    Returns:

          in ``source_names``.
        * ``unmoved_indices`` — sorted list of every ``i`` for which
          ``perm[i] == -1``. The host robot's joints at those indices
          stay at their current value (read from the live
          ``WorldState.joint_state``) — the wrapped planner did not
          schedule motion for them.

    Raises:
        ROSConfigError: If any joint in ``source_names`` is missing
            from ``target_names`` (set-extra on the source side).
