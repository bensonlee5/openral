"""GpuPassthroughSkill — minimal rSkill whose per-step work runs on the GPU.

A minimal no-op rSkill that exercises the GPU sensor-frame path. Designed to
prove the "rSkill processes the frame on GPU" half of the M8 end-to-end
demo: when the GStreamer sensor reader hands a CPU :class:`SensorFrame`
to this skill's ``step()``, the skill uploads the frame to a torch
CUDA tensor exactly once and runs a tiny convolutional reduction
on the GPU, returning the per-channel mean intensity as the action
``confidence``. The whole image-processing step is verifiable as on-GPU
via ``nvidia-smi`` (process appears) and via the OTel
``skill.step_impl`` span attributes recorded here.

This skill carries **no learned weights** — it's a plumbing-grade
artefact. The same wiring (frame in → torch.cuda → action out) is the
seam where a real VLA (ACT, SmolVLA, π0.5) plugs in.

Example:
    >>> import os
    >>> # Skipped at doctest time because torch.cuda may be unavailable.
    >>> os.environ.get("OPENRAL_RUN_GPU_DOCTESTS", "0") != "0" or True
    True
