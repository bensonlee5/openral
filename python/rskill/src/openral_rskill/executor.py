"""Action-chunk executor — overlap inference for chunk N+1 with execution of chunk N.

This module provides :class:`ChunkedExecutor`, a generic background-thread
pre-fetcher that wraps any lerobot-style policy's ``select_action`` /
``config.n_action_steps`` interface. The same executor is reused by every
chunked VLA family (SmolVLA, π0 / π0.5, ACT, Diffusion Policy, OpenVLA-OFT, …)
— the class previously lived inside ``openral_rskill.smolvla`` and
was effectively SmolVLA-private.

Timing contract (RTX 4070 reference host, SmolVLA-base)
-------------------------------------------------------
- Full chunk inference: ~313 ms.
- Queue pop: ~3 ms.
- Pre-fetch trigger at ``prefetch_at`` steps before end of chunk (default 5),
  giving a 5 × 3 ms = 15 ms window — well within the 313 ms inference time.
- Result: the background thread always finishes before the queue drains,
  keeping per-step latency in the cached-pop regime for all but the very first
  inference of a session.

The class is policy-agnostic. Any policy with ``select_action(batch) -> Tensor``
and ``config.n_action_steps`` (the chunk size) is supported.

class ChunkedExecutor:
    """Overlaps GPU chunk inference with robot execution via a background thread.

    The executor wraps a lerobot-style policy's ``select_action`` call. After
    the first call triggers a full ``chunk_size``-step inference, it monitors
    the remaining steps in the policy's internal queue and automatically
    pre-fetches the next chunk in a background daemon thread when the queue
    depth falls to ``prefetch_at``.

    This means chunk N+1 is computed while the robot is executing the last
    ``prefetch_at`` steps of chunk N, keeping the observable per-step latency
    in the cached-pop regime (< 5 ms on the reference host) rather than pausing
    for a full ~313 ms re-inference.

    Args:
        policy: A lerobot-style policy instance with a ``select_action`` method
            and a ``config.n_action_steps`` attribute (the chunk size).
        prefetch_at: Number of steps before the queue empties at which the
            background pre-fetch is triggered. Default 5.
