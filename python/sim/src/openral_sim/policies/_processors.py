"""Private helper for the manifest-first per-file processor-dir resolution.

Closes the three sister TODOs in :mod:`openral_sim.policies.diffusion`,
:mod:`openral_sim.policies.xvla`, and :mod:`openral_sim.policies.pi05` —
each previously called ``huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`` to fetch the
``policy_preprocessor.json`` / ``policy_postprocessor.json`` sidecars
needed by lerobot's ``make_pre_post_processors`` /
``PolicyProcessorPipeline.from_pretrained``. The SmolVLA and modern-ACT
adapters already migrated to the per-file URI contract declared on
``RSkillManifest.processors``; this helper extends the same
pattern to the remaining three adapters.

The function deliberately accepts the sim-layer ``VLASpec`` (and a raw
``repo_id`` fallback) rather than requiring callers to pre-load the
manifest themselves — the snapshot fallback is a real path that
explicit-scheme URIs still rely on (e.g. ``hf://lerobot/diffusion_pusht``,
which predates the per-file processor contract).

    Resolution order:

    1. If ``spec.weights_uri`` is a bare rSkill reference (no explicit

       block, call
       :func:`~openral_rskill._vla_core.materialize_processor_dir` —
       per-file ``hf_hub_download`` of exactly the two URIs

       is what explicit-scheme URIs (e.g. ``hf://lerobot/diffusion_pusht``,

        repo_id: The Hugging Face Hub repo id resolved from
            ``spec.weights_uri`` — used by the snapshot fallback.

        Absolute path to a directory containing
        ``policy_preprocessor.json`` and ``policy_postprocessor.json``
        either symlinked in by the manifest-first path or downloaded by
