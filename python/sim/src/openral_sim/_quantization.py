"""Shared policy quantization helpers for openral_sim policy adapters.

Pure-PyTorch / bitsandbytes utilities, extracted from the pi0.5
adapter so any future policy adapter (smolvla, xvla, pi0.6, ...) can
reuse the same quantization rules + fast-path loader without
copy-pasting:

* :func:`quantize_nf4_in_place` -- walk a policy's module tree and
  rewrite every large ``torch.nn.Linear`` into a ``bnb.nn.Linear4bit``.
  Defers the actual nf4 pack to the next ``.to(device)`` call, just
  like bitsandbytes does when used via ``BitsAndBytesConfig``.
* :func:`quantize_int8_in_place` -- sibling rewrite that swaps the
  same large Linears for ``bnb.nn.Linear8bitLt`` (LLM.int8 mixed
  decomposition, ~50% the bf16 footprint, lossless on most attention
  workloads). Used when the rSkill manifest declares ``dtype: int8``.
  bitsandbytes only offers 4-bit and 8-bit Linear classes — there is
  no ``nf8``; ``int8`` here means LLM.int8, not torchao dynamic int8.
* :func:`install_prequantized_linears` -- overlay a state dict produced
  by ``tools/quantize_rskill.py`` directly onto already-rewritten
  Linear4bit modules. Uses ``Params4bit.from_prequantized`` to avoid
  the ~30 s on-line bf16->nf4 conversion the standard ``.to(cuda)``
  path triggers.
* :func:`load_prequantized_state_for_rskill` -- combined entry point:
  read the rSkill manifest, probe the Hub for a
  ``quantization_metadata.json`` sentinel, download the prequantized
  weights, and call :func:`install_prequantized_linears`. The function
  is a silent no-op when the rSkill ships bf16 weights, so adapters
  can call it unconditionally after their own ``quantize_nf4_in_place``.
  Only nf4 prequant packs are recognised today; int8 always runs the
  on-line ``bnb.nn.Linear8bitLt`` rewrite.

These helpers are deliberately framework-agnostic. They don't know
what a pi0.5 / smolvla / xvla *is* -- they only know that the policy
is an ``nn.Module`` whose interesting Linears live ``>=4M elements``
deep in the tree. The matching upload-side script lives at
``tools/quantize_rskill.py``.

    heads stay in ``compute_dtype``. The bf16 weight is cloned into a
    ``bnb.nn.Int8Params`` placeholder; bitsandbytes packs it on the

    Unlike the nf4 path, there is no pre-quantized fast-path -- LLM.int8
    weights are not commonly shipped as a separate Hub artefact today
    (the SCB sub-state ownership inside ``Int8Params`` makes round-
    tripping through ``state_dict`` brittle). Callers that want a

            placeholder per Linear (roughly doubling the peak CPU
            footprint during the rewrite since the source Linears

            ``child.weight.data.clone()`` carries the real data into

            placeholder we skipped contributed nothing to the final
            state — and bitsandbytes still does its on-line int8 pack
            on the upcoming ``policy.to(<cuda>)`` because the cloned
