    Shared helper for the MuJoCo-backed :class:`SimRollout` adapters
    (``robocasa`` / ``libero`` / ``metaworld`` / ``aloha`` / the native
    backends) so the ``data.time``-to-nanoseconds conversion lives in exactly
    one place. ``mujoco.MjData.time`` is the authoritative
    elapsed simulation time in seconds, advanced by ``model.opt.timestep`` on
    every physics step; this rounds ``data.time * 1e9`` to the nearest integer
    nanosecond.

    Args:
        handles: The adapter's ``mujoco_handles()`` return — a
            ``(MjModel, MjData)`` tuple, or ``None`` when the backend exposes
            no live MuJoCo handle. ``model`` is unused (kept so callers pass the
            tuple verbatim).

    Returns:
        ``round(data.time * 1e9)`` when ``handles`` is a tuple, else ``None``
        (no MuJoCo clock available).

    Attributes:
        scene: Scene spec the rollout was built from.
        task:  Task spec it is currently solving.

    Optional duck-typed extensions (any of, mutually exclusive per adapter):
        ``mujoco_handles(self) -> tuple[mujoco.MjModel, mujoco.MjData] | None``
            — MuJoCo-backed adapters expose this so ``openral sim run --view``
            can open a passive ``mujoco.viewer`` window against the
            adapter's own ``MjModel`` / ``MjData``.

        ``sim_time_ns(self) -> int | None``
            — the backend's authoritative elapsed
            simulation time in nanoseconds — the seam a sim ``/clock``
            publisher reads so the deploy-sim ROS graph runs on simulation
            time rather than wall time. Contract:

            * MuJoCo-backed adapters return ``round(MjData.time * 1e9)`` (the
              physics clock advanced by ``model.opt.timestep`` per step) via
              :func:`sim_time_ns_from_mujoco_handles`.
            * SAPIEN / ManiSkill-backed adapters derive elapsed control time
              from the live env's elapsed step counter and control timestep.
            * The value is **monotonic non-decreasing within a single
              episode**. It is NOT guaranteed monotonic across ``reset`` —
              backends that rewind ``MjData.time`` to ``0`` on reset (e.g.
              robocasa) restart their clock, so a consumer that needs
              cross-reset monotonicity maintains its own offset (see
              :meth:`openral_hal.sim_attached.SimAttachedHAL.sim_time_ns`).
            * Returns ``None`` when the backend has **no sim clock** —
              clock-less backends (PushT) and sidecars whose wire protocol does
              not carry elapsed time.

            Like the other extensions it is intentionally NOT part of the
            Protocol, so a clock-less adapter need not stub it. Callers MUST
            use ``getattr(env, "sim_time_ns", None)`` and treat both a missing
            attribute and a ``None`` return as "no sim clock" (fall back to
            wall time).

        ``viewer_render(self) -> None``
            — Adapters whose underlying engine owns the live viewer
            and needs per-step pumping (e.g. SAPIEN / ManiSkill3 envs
            constructed with ``render_mode='human'``). :class:`SimRunner`
            calls this once per applied step to pump the viewer; the
            adapter is responsible for promoting / opening the window
            on the first call and tearing it down in :meth:`close`.

        ``enable_intrinsic_viewer(self) -> None``
            — Adapters whose engine draws its own self-managed window
            and does not need per-step pumping (e.g. ``gym_pusht`` with
            ``render_mode="human"``; the engine updates the window inside
            its own ``step`` / ``reset``). :class:`SimRunner` calls this
            ONCE before the first ``reset()`` when ``--view`` is set, then
            skips both the MuJoCo viewer path AND the per-step
            ``viewer_render`` pump.

        All three extensions are intentionally *not* part of the Protocol
        so adapters do not need to stub a method they cannot honour;
        callers MUST use ``getattr(env, "<name>", None)`` and treat both
        a missing attribute and a ``None`` return as "viewer unsupported".
