"""Compose the ``tabletop_push`` MJCF — robot-agnostic, MjSpec-based.

Unlike :mod:`openral_sim.backends.so101_box._assets` (which regex-splices its
task world into the SO-ARM101 MJCF and is therefore coupled to that robot's
``<body name="base">`` / ``<body name="gripper">`` / ``"1"``..``"6"`` schema),
this composer is **robot as a flag**: it works against any arm whose manifest
declares an ``assets.mjcf``.

How it stays robot-agnostic
---------------------------
* The robot's own MJCF is loaded into a :class:`mujoco.MjSpec`; the task world
  (table, cube, goal marker, cameras, light) is **appended** to that spec's
  ``worldbody``. Appending never reorders the robot's joints/actuators, so the
  composed model's actuator and qpos indices stay 1:1 with ``description.joints``
  in declaration order — exactly the contract
  :meth:`openral_hal.MujocoArmHAL._sim_kwargs_for` relies on. The free objects'
  qpos land *after* the robot's, so driving the robot by its low actuator
  indices is correct regardless of which robot is loaded.
* The robot base is re-anchored by mutating the spec's **root body**
  (``worldbody.bodies[0]``) — no body-name lookup, so an SO-ARM ``base``, a
  Franka ``link0`` and a UR ``base`` are all handled identically.
* The robot's base MJCF is resolved from the manifest via
  :func:`openral_core.assets.resolve_asset` (the same source
  ``build_hal(mode="sim")`` uses) — the manifest is the single robot-MJCF
  contract across ``sim run`` / ``deploy sim`` / ``deploy run``.

The composed model is returned directly (no sibling XML file): MjSpec embeds the
resolved meshes at compile time, so there is nothing to resolve relative to a
written path.

class TabletopOptions:
    """Every dimension and pose the ``tabletop_push`` scene exposes.

    Lengths are metres, angles are radians unless suffixed ``_deg``. Defaults
    suit a small tabletop arm (the SO-101 proof-of-concept robot); a larger arm
    (Franka, UR) typically wants the table and spawn ranges tuned via the
    YAML ``scene.backend_options`` — the composition mechanism is identical
    either way.

    Attributes:
        table_size_xy: Full ``(X, Y)`` extent of the tabletop slab in metres.
        table_top_z: World-Z of the table's top surface in metres. The robot
            base is mounted at this height by default (``robot_base_xyz`` z).
        table_thickness: Thickness of the table slab in metres.
        table_center_xy: World ``(X, Y)`` centre of the table slab.
        robot_base_xyz: Fallback world-frame position of the robot root body,
            in metres, used only when the scene YAML omits ``base_pose:``.
        robot_base_yaw_deg: Fallback rotation about world +Z applied to the
            robot root body, degrees. Used only when ``base_pose:`` is omitted.
        cube_size: Half-extent ``(X, Y, Z)`` of the manipuland cube, metres.
        cube_mass: Cube mass in kg.
        cube_spawn_xy_range: Cube spawn area in world frame, given as
            ``((x_min, x_max), (y_min, y_max))``. The cube spawns resting on
            the table at a random ``(x, y)`` within this range each ``reset``.
        goal_spawn_xy_range: Goal-marker spawn area, same shape. The goal is a
            flat visual disc on the table surface; success is geometric (cube
            centre within ``goal_radius`` of it).
        goal_radius: Success XY tolerance — the cube centre must be within this
            radius of the goal centre, metres.
        goal_min_separation: Minimum cube↔goal centre separation at spawn,
            metres (so the task always requires a non-trivial push).
        off_table_z_tol: Success also requires the cube to still be resting on
            the table — its centre Z within this tolerance of the resting
            height ``table_top_z + cube_size_z``. Guards against "cube knocked
            off the table happens to pass over the goal XY" false positives.
        top_camera_pos: World-frame position of the top-down camera.
        top_camera_fovy: Top-down camera vertical FoV, degrees.
        front_camera_pos: World-frame position of the front camera.
        front_camera_fovy: Front camera vertical FoV, degrees.
        wrist_camera_mount_body: When set, the composed model parents a
            ``wrist`` camera to the named MJCF body (the robot's end-effector
            link, e.g. ``"gripper"`` for SO-101 or ``"hand"`` for Franka). Left
            ``None``, callers may infer the mount from the robot manifest's
            ``sensors[].sim_placement.parent_body`` for the ``wrist`` camera.
            A name absent from the loaded MJCF fails loudly.
        wrist_camera_pos_local: Wrist-camera position in the mount-body frame.
        wrist_camera_fovy: Wrist-camera vertical FoV, degrees.
        settle_steps: ``mj_step`` calls after each action write — the scene's
            position actuators are advanced this many steps per ``step()``.
        initial_joint_positions: Optional reset pose in the same convention as
            ``joint_units`` plus the calibration affine. Empty means use the
            robot MJCF's default qpos. Values are clipped to the robot joint
            limits before writing qpos/ctrl.
        joint_units: Unit convention for the robot joint state/action
            boundary. ``"radians"`` is sim-native; ``"degrees"`` is for
            LeRobot SO-100/SO-101 checkpoints that record servo degrees.
        joint_offsets_deg: Per-actuator affine offset used only when
            ``joint_units == "degrees"``:
            ``policy_deg = sign * scale * mujoco_deg + offset``.
        joint_signs: Per-actuator affine sign, each ``+1`` or ``-1``.
        joint_scales: Per-actuator affine scale (policy degrees per MuJoCo
            degree), positive values only. Empty means identity scale.
        ambient_light: Headlight ambient RGB lifted into the scene so the
            table top renders with even illumination.
        instruction: Default natural-language task instruction (the YAML
            ``task.instruction`` overrides it).
        extra_metadata: Free-form string map echoed into scene metadata.
