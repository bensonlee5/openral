"""Compose the OpenArm v2 tabletop pick-and-place MJCF.

The upstream ``enactic/openarm_mujoco`` v2 bimanual MJCF ships with
``<position>`` actuators (internal PD, gains tuned per joint class).
That works for behaviour-cloning rollouts where the policy commands
joint angles directly — but a robosuite OSC controller produces
**torques**, so the scene we hand it must expose direct ``<motor>``
actuators on every joint.

This module produces a single composite XML string that:

1. Wraps the upstream MJCF as a ``<worldbody>`` snippet by reading it
   and splicing out (a) its outer ``<mujoco>`` tag, (b) the
   ``<actuator>`` block, and (c) the trailing ``</worldbody>``;
2. Re-anchors the OpenArm base in a known frame above a robosuite
   ``TableArena``-style table top;
3. Adds the manipulation scene: three coloured cubes
   (red / green / blue), a passive parallel-jaw drawer (prismatic
   joint), and three RGB cameras (``top``, ``wrist_left``,
   ``wrist_right``) at the resolutions the pi05 LoRA was trained on;
4. Emits ``<motor>`` actuators for all 16 joints (7 arm + 1 finger per
   side), inheriting the upstream ``<equality>`` constraint that
   yokes the second finger to the first;
5. Preserves the upstream ``meshdir="assets"`` so the cached MJCF's
   sibling ``assets/`` directory still resolves at compile time.

The resulting string is fed to :func:`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string`
with an ``asset_root`` callback so the OpenArm meshes load from the
upstream cache without copying them.

The actuator inventory + per-joint ctrlrange / forcerange numbers are
**derived from a loaded** :class:`openral_core.RobotDescription` (see
:func:`actuator_specs_from_description`) — there is no module-level
copy of the openarm joint table anymore. Same for the "top" overview
camera placement: the default ``pos`` / ``target`` / ``fovy`` come from
:attr:`RobotDescription.scene_defaults.top_camera` on the supplied
description, with the YAML's ``scene.backend_options.top_camera_*``
keys still overriding when set.

Honest scope note
-----------------
Only the **structural** composition is exercised today (smoke-tested
by ``tests/sim/test_openarm_scene_pnp.py``). The motor-actuator
control-range numbers (``effort_limit`` in
``robots/openarm/robot.yaml``) are passed through as ``forcerange`` /
``ctrlrange``; whether they need per-joint tuning to keep robosuite
OSC stable on this rig will surface the first time we close the loop
with a real VLA chunk.

            aims at. ``None`` falls back to
            ``robot_description.scene_defaults.top_camera.target``.
        top_camera_fovy: Vertical field-of-view in degrees for the
            ``top`` camera. ``None`` falls back to
            ``robot_description.scene_defaults.top_camera.fovy``.

            per-robot scene defaults so this composer no longer carries
            its own copy of either.
