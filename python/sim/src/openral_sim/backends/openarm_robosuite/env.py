"""OpenArm v2 bimanual tabletop scene with direct joint-position targets.

Pairs with :mod:`._assets` (which generates the MJCF) to expose a
:class:`SimRollout` driven through the upstream OpenArm v2 MJCF position
actuators. The 16-D action chunk emitted by the pi05 OpenArm checkpoints
flows in as ``[left_j1..7, left_grip, right_j1..7, right_grip]``; the env
splits it per arm, clips each joint target to the MJCF limits, writes
``data.ctrl`` directly, and steps the MuJoCo sim.

Honest scope note
-----------------
This is the first cut. The structural integration is verified by
``tests/sim/test_openarm_scene_pnp.py`` (loads the scene, runs zero
actions, reads the observation dict, renders a frame). The closed-loop
task score still depends on the checkpoint being in-distribution for this
simple drawer/cube layout.
