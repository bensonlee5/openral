"""Policy-family dependency probing — shared by reasoner + skill_runner.

The policy factories in :mod:`openral_sim.policies` live behind opt-in
extras groups (``sim`` / ``libero`` / ``metaworld`` / ``robocasa``):
``transformers``, ``bitsandbytes``, ``lerobot[…]``, etc. When the right
group isn't installed the factory raises ``ImportError`` deep inside
lerobot, which (a) is confusing to surface and (b) leaves
partially-loaded modules in ``sys.modules`` so subsequent calls fail
with a *different* ``cannot import name 'X'`` cascade error.

This module is the single source of truth for two related contracts:

* :func:`model_family_install_hint` — the actionable uv-sync command for
  each known family. Used by :mod:`openral_rskill_ros.rskill_runner_node`
  when translating a factory ``ImportError`` into ``ROSRuntimeError``.
* :func:`can_import_policy_family` /
  :func:`filter_importable_manifests` — pre-flight probes used by the
  reasoner at ``on_configure`` to drop rSkills whose deps aren't
  installed *before* the palette is built. This way the operator sees
  one warning at boot ("dropped X: missing transformers; run
  ``just sync --all-packages --group sim``"), not a confusing per-tick
  failure at goal dispatch time.

All install commands recommended by this module go through
``just sync --all-packages --group <X>`` rather than bare
``uv sync --group <X>``. ``--all-packages`` is required so the
workspace members (openral-core, openral-cli, …) survive the install
— ``uv sync`` without it would uninstall every workspace member and
the next ROS launch would fail with ``No module named 'openral_core'``.
``just sync`` additionally repairs the ``hf-libero==0.1.3``
distutils-uninstall trap before+after the sync.

The probe never instantiates a factory or loads weights — it only
imports the deepest lerobot/transformers module each family touches.
That's fast (≈100 ms for the lerobot tree on a warm filesystem) and
deterministic.

Adding a new policy family: register a new entry in
:data:`_FAMILY_REQUIRED_IMPORTS` AND :data:`_FAMILY_INSTALL_HINTS`.
The reasoner's ``test_reasoner_palette_filters_unimportable_families``
test (and ``test_known_model_families_get_concrete_install_hints``)
walks both dicts so a half-registered family fails at unit-test time.
