r"""Benchmark runner — loop a ``list[BenchmarkScene]`` and emit a :class:`RSkillEvalResult`.

This runner later dropped an earlier ``BenchmarkSpec`` wrapper class, so a
benchmark suite is now a bare ``list[BenchmarkScene]`` on disk
(``benchmarks/<suite_id>.yaml``) and in
memory. The suite id is the filename stem. The runner is the **only**
way to produce a ``rskills/<vla>/eval/<suite_id>.json`` with
``reproduced_locally=true``; hand-edited JSONs continue to be valid but
they carry ``reproduced_locally=false`` and a ``reproduction_cli`` that
points back at ``openral benchmark run`` so users can close the loop
locally.

The runner is intentionally a thin layer over :class:`SimRunner`:

* For every (``scene``, ``seed``) tuple in
  ``scenes × range(seed, seed + n_episodes)``, build a one-episode
  :class:`SimEnvironment` and drive it with a fresh :class:`SimRunner`
  (sim and hardware share the same
  :class:`InferenceRunner` Protocol). Each :class:`BenchmarkScene`
  carries its own ``robot_id``, ``task``, ``n_episodes``, ``seed``, and
  paper provenance (suite-level invariants — uniformity of robot_id /
  n_episodes / seed / metadata, unique task ids, non-empty — are
  validated by :func:`openral_core.raise_on_invalid_suite`).
* Aggregate per-task success rates + the overall average into a
  :class:`RSkillEvalResult`. The numbers are computed inside
  :func:`_aggregate_results` so callers (CLI + tests) share the same
  rolled-up shape.

    Single-scene counterpart of :func:`run_benchmark` — the rollout loop

    run --suite``). Iterates ``range(scene.seed, scene.seed + scene.n_episodes)``
    against the one ``(scene, task)`` pair carried by the
    :class:`BenchmarkScene` and emits the same :class:`RSkillEvalResult`
    JSON shape so paper-comparison reports stay uniform.

    Args:
        scene: The published-protocol benchmark scene — exactly one task
            and a scalar ``seed`` (the seed list is derived as
            ``[seed, seed+1, …, seed+n_episodes-1]``).
        vla: The single free axis — which rSkill to evaluate. ``weights_uri``
            must be a bare rSkill reference; the strict runner rejects
            raw ``hf://`` URIs.
        device: Optional torch device override applied to every rollout.
        save_dir: Optional directory written to each :class:`SimEnvironment`

        config_path: Optional path to the BenchmarkScene YAML this scene
            was loaded from — embedded into ``RSkillEvalSource.reproduction_cli``
            so reviewers can re-run the exact eval from disk.
        record_video: When True, capture per-step world frames into each
            :class:`EpisodeResult.frames` so callers can write clean
            website MP4s (``openral benchmark scene --save-video``). Off by
            default — eval/CI runs stay allocation-light.
        view: Tri-state viewer flag, identical in meaning to ``openral sim
            run --view/--no-view``. ``None`` (default) keeps the headless
            behaviour benchmark rollouts have always had — eval artefacts
            and CI/deploy runs are unaffected. ``True`` opens a passive
            ``mujoco.viewer`` window per episode and streams the rollout
            (strict — raises on a missing display); ``False`` forces
            offscreen. Resolved through :func:`openral_sim.cli._resolve_view`
            so the ``MUJOCO_GL`` / ``DISPLAY`` semantics match ``sim run``.
