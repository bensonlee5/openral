"""Bare ``MujocoArmHAL`` staleness recovery + idle-step (deploy-sim regression).

Two coupled regressions surfaced by ``openral deploy sim`` against a bare
:class:`~openral_hal._mujoco_arm.MujocoArmHAL` (e.g. ``OpenArmMujocoHAL``):

1. **Latched ``ROSPerceptionStale``.** ``read_state`` reads live in-process
   ``MjData`` (always the current simulator state), yet it refreshed the
   staleness clock only on the *success* path. If the single-threaded executor
   stalled >``staleness_limit_s`` between two publish ticks — e.g. a slow camera
   render hogging the thread — the next ``read_state`` raised *before* the
   refresh, so the clock never advanced and every subsequent read raised too.
   The HAL bricked itself permanently ("Joint state is X s old" logged
   constantly) despite the data being perfectly current.

2. **No dedicated publisher thread.** A bare ``MujocoArmHAL`` lacked
   ``idle_step``, so the lifecycle node published ``/joint_states`` from a timer
   on the executor (starved by rendering) instead of the dedicated
   thread + ``ProprioSnapshot``, and its cameras froze when idle.

These tests build a *real* native-MuJoCo arm (no mocks, CLAUDE.md §1.11). A
bare arm's ``connect()`` does not render, so no GL/display is required; the only
external need is the menagerie MJCF, fetched on first use — unavailable →
``pytest.skip``.
