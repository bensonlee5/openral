"""Generic sim camera rig.

Splice a robot's manifest-declared RGB cameras into a bare-arm MJCF that ships
no ``<camera>`` elements, so a ``deploy sim`` :class:`~openral_hal._mujoco_arm.MujocoArmHAL`
twin renders the cameras the manifest declares — without a per-robot scene
composer or any ``scene_defaults.composition`` hook on the robot manifest.

Each RGB :class:`~openral_core.SensorSpec` that carries a
:class:`~openral_core.CameraSimPlacement` is spliced as a ``<camera>`` either
into its ``parent_body`` (a wrist camera that tracks the gripper) or into
``<worldbody>`` (a world-fixed overhead / third-person camera). The rig is
**idempotent**: a camera already present in the MJCF (a scene-attached or
already-composed model) is left untouched, so this composes cleanly with the
scene-attach path and prop composers (openarm).

The camera's MuJoCo name is ``sim_camera_name or name`` — the same key
:meth:`MujocoArmHAL.read_images` renders — so the rig and the reader agree by
construction.
