"""SimAttachedHAL — wrap any ``openral_sim.SimRollout`` as a HAL adapter.

The generic, robot-agnostic bridge between the
:class:`openral_sim.SimRollout` simulator interface and the
:class:`openral_hal.HAL` Protocol the ROS lifecycle nodes consume.

The motivating problem: a HAL ROS lifecycle node + a robocasa env
historically lived in separate processes (the launch tree spawns the
HAL; ``openral_sim.SimRunner`` spawns the env). With the two split,
``/scan`` couldn't ray-cast against live MJCF geometry because the
lifecycle node had no handle to ``MjModel``/``MjData``. The bringup
script we used for the navigate-look-pick recordings co-located them
in one process by hand. This module is the in-process composition
made first-class.

Architecture
------------

* :class:`SimAttachedHAL` implements the structural
  :class:`openral_hal.HAL` Protocol against any
  :class:`openral_sim.rollout.SimRollout` instance. Reading state
  walks ``description.joints`` and looks up live qpos / qvel from
  the env's MJCF handles; sending an action calls ``env.step(...)``.

* The lifecycle node uses :class:`SimAttachedHAL` in place of the
  per-robot digital-twin HAL whenever its
  ``sim_env_yaml`` ROS param is set, then binds its
  ``mujoco_handle_provider`` to ``self._hal.mujoco_handles()`` so the
  ray-cast ``/scan`` generator sees the live MJCF.

* Generic across embodiments: any robot whose
  :class:`~openral_core.RobotDescription` declares the joint mapping
  (``JointSpec.sim_joint_name`` or matching ``name``s the env emits)
  works. The translation between the HAL :class:`Action` and the
  env's flat action vector is delegated to a small per-robot
  ``ActionPacker`` (see :func:`pack_action_for_env`).

CLAUDE.md §1.5 / §3
-------------------
The hot path (``read_state`` / ``send_action``) must complete within
the robot's control cycle. ``env.step`` is the slowest call —
robocasa steps ~5-15 ms per call on the reference host, well inside
the 50 ms (20 Hz) Nav2 cmd_vel budget.

This is a HAL adapter, not a safety shim. The safety supervisor's
contract holds: every action passing through here has already been
clamped by the C++ kernel.

        SIM-ONLY. This refreshes ``_last_obs`` (camera frames + state) so the
        perception / object-detector bus sees a live scene even when
        no skill is executing — without this the env only steps on
        ``/openral/safe_action`` receipt, so an idle scene freezes physics and
        cameras go stale.

        Safety: this method is defined ONLY on :class:`SimAttachedHAL`. Real
        HALs (Franka FCI, ros2_control bridges, lerobot followers) do NOT
        define it, and the :class:`~openral_hal.sim_sensor_bridge.SimSensorBridge`
        gates its idle timer on ``callable(getattr(hal, "idle_step", None))``,
        so the timer is never even created against a real HAL. This is the real
        guarantee — NOT "zero is harmless": a zero vector is a HOLD for the
        sim's velocity / OSC-delta controllers, but on a real absolute-position
        arm it would command "drive every joint to 0 rad" (violent). The
        method-only-on-sim exclusion is what makes the zero action safe.

        Does NOT touch the commanded-slot state (``_last_env_action``) nor the
        latched base twist (``_last_body_twist``) — an idle HOLD is orthogonal
        to whatever a skill last commanded; the next ``send_action`` resumes
        from its own merged state.

        Caveat — zero is a true HOLD only for the sim's velocity / OSC-delta /
        robosuite composite controllers. For a **position-controlled native
        backend** (e.g. ``so101_box``, whose ``step`` consumes joint-position
        targets) a zero vector commands the joints *toward 0 rad* rather than
        holding the current pose. That is acceptable here — the goal is to keep
        the scene physically live so cameras render, not to freeze the arm in
        place — but it is NOT a literal hold for those backends.

        Action-dim note: ``_env_action_dim`` is the env's authoritative width,
        resolved by :meth:`_probe_env_action_dim` from the backend's own
        ``action_dim`` (every native backend — ``so101_box`` → 6,
        ``tabletop_push`` → actuator count, ``openarm_tabletop_pnp`` →
        ``state_dim`` — now reports it). A backend that exposes no width and
        carries no override fails loudly at ``connect`` time, so the idle tick
        never builds a wrong-width zero vector. (The bridge's catch-once-and-
        disable guard around :meth:`idle_step` remains as defence in depth.)

        Returns:
            ``True`` if the env was stepped, ``False`` if suppressed (not

        """Full 6-DoF base pose ``(xyz, quat_xyzw)`` from the cached robocasa obs.

        ``base_pose`` (planar ``x, y, yaw``) is what the panda_mobile
        HAL was originally designed around — Nav2 / SLAM consume that
        as a 2-D twist + yaw. But the rldx / pi05 state assemblers
         read the base's *full* 6-DoF pose via
        ``tf("odom", "base_link")``, and the planar version sets
        ``z = 0.0`` + ``roll = pitch = 0``, which silently drops the
        ~0.70 m platform height that RoboCasa proprio
        (``robot0_base_pos[2]``) reports. Symptom in ``openral deploy sim``:
        the assembled ``world_to_base.position.z`` is ``0.0`` instead
        of ``0.70``, so the policy sees the arm 0.49 m higher in the
        base frame than at training time and tries to reach a target
        that's at the wrong height — the "robot moves but grabs at
        the wrong position" failure mode the dump diff exposed.

        Source of truth: ``_last_obs["raw_proprio"]["robot0_base_pos"]``
        + ``["robot0_base_quat"]`` — the values the RoboCasa env's
        robosuite observable system computes (the SAME values
        ``openral sim run`` feeds to the policy via
        ``robot0_base_pos`` in the 16-D ``human300`` state vector).
        Reading them here keeps the deploy_sim ``odom → base_link``
        TF byte-identical to what sim_run's state assembly produces.

        Note: ``data.xpos[robot0_base]`` (raw MJCF body world-frame
        position) is NOT the same as ``robot0_base_pos`` — robosuite's
        observable wraps the body lookup with a robot-specific offset
        (``robot.robot_model.base_xpos_offset``) so the publicly
        reported "base position" matches a stable robot-mount
        reference, not the MJCF body's own anchor. We MUST use the
        observable's output, not the raw xpos, or the policy sees a
        translated world.

        Returns ``None`` when the wrapped obs has no ``raw_proprio``
        slot (non-RoboCasa backend) or the keys are missing — the
        caller falls back to the planar :attr:`base_pose`.
