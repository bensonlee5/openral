""":class:`ContextRenderer` — renders the reasoner's per-tick prompt context.

Builds the structured **text** context the reasoner LLM consumes each
tick. No pixels in v1: the context is a rolling text
digest of

* the latest :class:`~openral_core.WorldState` snapshot (joint state,
  EE pose, staleness, control mode);
* the recent :class:`FailureTrigger` events received per source bus
  (FIFO buffers, one per ``/openral/failure/<source>``);
* the recent ``/openral/perception/<kind>`` events;
* any pending operator prompts.

Output is deterministic, byte-stable for a given input, and bounded in
size — small enough for a 4k context window even when every buffer is
full.
