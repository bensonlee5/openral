"""Typed mission state for sequential multi-task deploy goals.

An operator goal may carry several ordered subtasks supplied via ``--initial-task``
(or a live ``/openral/prompt``). Prior to this module's fix the deploy CLI
joined ``DeployScene.tasks`` with ``" | "`` into a single opaque prompt that was
**drained pull-once** (``ContextRenderer.drain_prompts``), so the reasoner forgot
the goal after the first tick and never advanced to subsequent subtasks (removed).

This module is the deterministic fix: the goal is parsed into an
ordered list of :class:`TaskState`, of which at most one is ``active`` (or
``verifying``) at a time. The reasoner advances the queue only when the active
task is verified complete, so a multi-task goal is *sequenced* by
bookkeeping rather than by hoping the LLM remembers it. Splitting is intentionally
simple and deterministic; richer decomposition (the ``decompose-mission``
playbook) layers on top via :meth:`MissionState.subdivide_active`.

This module (#123) adds **hierarchical subdivision on replan**: when
the active task is blocked (reward gate ``abandon``, ladder exhausted) the
reasoner may decompose it into finer subtasks instead of only handing off. The
data model stays **flat** — :meth:`MissionState.subdivide_active` *splices* the
blocked task in place with its children (``t2 → t2.1, t2.2``), so the ``##
MISSION`` ledger and the dashboard (which rebuild from the flat task list each
tick) need no change. :attr:`TaskState.depth` bounds re-decomposition
(:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_SUBDIVIDE_DEPTH`) so a perpetually-blocked task terminates in
``human-handoff`` rather than subdividing forever.

The state is reasoner-internal (no rclpy, no Pydantic boundary) so it lives here
as plain dataclasses and is fully unit-testable; the ROS node drives the
transitions and the :class:`~openral_reasoner.context.ContextRenderer` renders the
``## MISSION`` ledger.

    **Gate on the PROGRESS head, not the success head.**
    Robometer-4B emits two heads: ``progress`` (task *closeness*, which reaches
    ~0.80-0.86 on a genuine physical success and separates success from failure
    cleanly) and ``success`` (a done-probability that is empirically *compressed*
    — only ~0.56-0.79 even on a real success, so a 0.8 auto-pass bar over it is
    effectively dead). The ``success_threshold`` / ``check_floor`` bars (0.8 /
    0.5) were calibrated against the *progress* head (internal calibration notes
    cite progress≈0.78 on a physical success), so the band logic gates on
    ``progress_now``. ``success_now`` is kept as a **secondary corroborating
    signal** surfaced in the verdict text (and available to the caller's
    ``vlm_check`` adjudication) — it never overrides the progress band.

    Three-tier verdict over the progress head when the reward is available
    (``ok=True``):

    1. ``progress_now >= success_threshold`` → ``"complete"`` — high-confidence
       auto-pass; no VLM call needed.
    2. ``check_floor <= progress_now < success_threshold`` → ``"vlm_check"`` — the
       ambiguous band; the **caller** must adjudicate by calling ``describe_image``,
       optionally weighing ``success_now`` as corroboration. This
       function only signals the need — it never performs the call.
    3. ``progress_now < check_floor`` → falls to the existing attempts ladder:
       ``"abandon"`` once ``attempts >= max_attempts``, else ``"retry"``.

    ``ok=False`` (reward unavailable / stale): no tier evaluation; goes directly to
    the attempts ladder so reward errors never produce a spurious completion.

    The caller is assumed to pass ``check_floor <= success_threshold``; the
    ``RewardContract`` validator guarantees this upstream — no re-validation here.

    Returns ``(action, verdict_text)`` where ``verdict_text`` is the short
    human-readable note recorded on the task (progress is primary; success is
    appended as corroboration when supplied).
