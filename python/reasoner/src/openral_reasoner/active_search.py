"""Bounded active object search over the scene graph.

When a spatial-memory recall misses (``ROSObjectNotInMemory`` / empty
``RecallObjectResult``), a useful robot does not give up — it searches *likely*
places. This module turns a :class:`~openral_core.SceneGraph` into a
**bounded, ranked frontier** of places to check, so the S2 Reasoner can drive a
search loop that terminates instead of running forever.

Two responsibilities, both pure-Python (``openral_core`` only):

- **Candidate frontier** — :func:`plan_active_search` lists the places/containers
  worth checking, ranked by a generic heuristic (occluding containers first —
  things hide inside them — then standable places). Semantic prioritization
  *among* candidates ("a glass is usually in a cabinet") is the LLM's job via
  its commonsense priors; this supplies the bounded set it chooses from.
- **The bound** — :class:`SearchBudget` caps the frontier (and, via
  :class:`SearchProgress`, the number of attempts). Exhausting the budget is the
  terminal *human-handoff* rung of the replanning ladder, not an
  unbounded loop.
