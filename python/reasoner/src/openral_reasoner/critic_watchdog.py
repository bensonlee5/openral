"""Tier-C critic progress-stall / success watchdog for ``/openral/failure/critic`` (R3).

The OpenRAL failure bus reserves ``/openral/failure/critic`` for **Tier-C**
triggers (per the 2026-05-25 amendment failure-tier taxonomy:
``safety→A``, ``hal/sensor/rskill/wam→B``, ``critic→C``). Until now that topic
had no default producer, so a robot whose task progress silently *stalls* —
the policy keeps emitting action chunks but the scene stops moving toward the
goal — emitted no structured signal and the S2 reasoner could not react.

This module ships the **decision core**: :class:`CriticWatchdog`, a pure,
import-safe state machine (no ``rclpy``) that consumes a stream of per-frame
progress/critic scores and decides *when* to wake the reasoner — either because
progress has **stalled** or because the attempt is **likely done** (success). It
emits the real :class:`openral_core.CriticEvidence` (it does **not** invent a
schema) so a thin ROS node can publish it on the bus unchanged.

The score source is intentionally **abstract**: any reward model that emits a
higher-is-better scalar drives the same watchdog — the Robometer reward rSkill
today, a future SARM (self-assessment reward model), a success
classifier, or a hand-rolled heuristic. None of them is special-cased; a critic
is just a ``(critic_id, score, threshold)`` stream. :class:`CriticWatchdogGroup`
multiplexes one :class:`CriticWatchdog` per ``critic_id`` so several critics
share the single ``/openral/failure/critic`` source and each fires its own
:class:`CriticEvidence` independently.

Stall semantics (deterministic, fully covered by ``tests/test_critic_watchdog.py``):

- The watchdog keeps a running **best** score (the highest seen since the last
  reset or recovery) and a consecutive-**stall** counter.
- An observation counts as **progress** iff ``score > best + min_delta`` — it
  strictly beats the running best by more than ``min_delta``. Progress updates
  ``best``, zeroes the stall counter, and clears the stall latch.
- An observation with ``score >= threshold`` is a **success/recovery**: it
  zeroes the stall counter, clears the stall latch (and updates ``best`` when
  it is also a new best), and fires a one-shot :class:`CriticEvidence` the
  *first* time per streak (see success semantics below).
- Otherwise (``score < threshold`` and not progress) the observation is a
  **stall** and increments the counter.
- When the counter reaches ``stall_patience`` consecutive stalls **and** the
  watchdog is not already stall-latched, :meth:`observe` returns one
  :class:`CriticEvidence` and **latches** — subsequent stalled observations
  return ``None`` to avoid spamming the bus. The stall latch clears on progress
  or recovery (above threshold), or on :meth:`reset`.

Success semantics (reward-watcher wakes the reasoner promptly):

- When ``score >= threshold`` and the **success latch** is not set, :meth:`observe`
  returns one :class:`CriticEvidence` and sets the success latch.
- Subsequent samples at or above threshold return ``None`` (one-shot per streak).
- The success latch clears whenever the score drops back below ``threshold`` (any
  sub-threshold observation, whether progress or stall) so a new crossing fires
  again. :meth:`reset` also clears it.
- If a sample would trigger both a stall fire and a success fire (``score``
  exactly equals ``threshold`` after exactly ``stall_patience`` stalls), the
  success path takes precedence because ``is_recovery = score >= threshold`` is
  checked first.

Intended wiring: a critic producer node subscribes to the generic
``/openral/critic/score`` topic (``openral_msgs/CriticScore`` — any reward model
publishes its self-describing ``(critic_id, score, threshold)`` samples there),
routes each sample through a :class:`CriticWatchdogGroup`, and on a non-``None``
return publishes via
``FailureBusPublisher(node, FailureSource.CRITIC).publish(kind=KIND_CRITIC,
severity=SEVERITY_FAIL, evidence=<that CriticEvidence>)``
(see :mod:`openral_observability.failure_bus`). The ``reasoner_node`` then maps
the resulting ``/openral/failure/critic`` (FAIL) event onto a forced Tier-C
tick — ``ReasonerCore.tick(..., force=True, tier="C")`` — which is already
supported (the tick stamps ``reasoner.tier`` on its OTel span). The producer
calls :meth:`CriticWatchdogGroup.reset` whenever the reasoner context shifts
(new operator prompt / new task), mirroring ``ReasonerCore.reset_kind_streak``.

Example:
    >>> from openral_reasoner import CriticWatchdog
    >>> wd = CriticWatchdog(
    ...     critic_id="OpenRAL/rskill-robometer-4b",
    ...     threshold=0.8,
    ...     stall_patience=3,
    ... )
    >>> wd.observe(0.4) is None  # stall 1 (below threshold, sets best)
    True
    >>> wd.observe(0.4) is None  # stall 2
    True
    >>> evidence = wd.observe(0.4)  # stall 3 → stall fire
    >>> evidence.kind, evidence.critic_id, evidence.score, evidence.threshold
    ('critic', 'OpenRAL/rskill-robometer-4b', 0.4, 0.8)
    >>> wd.observe(0.4) is None  # stall-latched — no repeat fire
    True
    >>> success_ev = wd.observe(0.9)  # crosses threshold → success fire, clears stall latch
    >>> success_ev.score
    0.9
    >>> wd.observe(0.9) is None  # success-latched
    True
