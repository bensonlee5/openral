"""Typed tool-call dispatch, per-skill tool palette — :class:`ToolPalette` + builder.

The palette is the *closed set* of choices the LLM sees on every
:meth:`ToolUseClient.select_tool` call. It is built at reasoner
lifecycle ``configure`` time from the local rSkill registry filtered
by the active robot's :class:`~openral_core.RobotCapabilities`, and
refreshed when ``/openral/skill_registry_changed`` fires (fired by
``ral skill install|remove``).

Tool palette built at lifecycle configure: the LLM cannot dispatch a
skill that isn't installed, isn't capability-matched, or isn't
licensed for the deployment. This module enforces the "installed +
capability-matched" half; license posture is checked downstream by the
action server (defense in depth) when the goal is accepted.

The palette carries per-skill metadata (:class:`RSkillToolEntry`) so
the LLM tool schema can present each skill as its own tool with a real
description + action verbs + object / scene discriminators, instead of
a single ``execute_rskill`` tool with an opaque list of ids.

    ``control_modes_for_representation``) to decide whether a VLA skill is

    segment wider than the robot's joint count) without changing any drop /
