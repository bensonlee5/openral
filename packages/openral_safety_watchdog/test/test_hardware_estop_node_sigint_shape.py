"""hardware_estop_node SIGINT teardown contract — structural regression guard.

Mirrors ``packages/openral_reasoner_ros/test/test_reasoner_node_sigint_shape.py``
(the canonical reference for this pattern across the deploy graph). ROS 2
Jazzy installs a SIGINT signal handler in :func:`rclpy.init` that:

1. Shuts down the rclpy context.
2. Raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` out of :func:`rclpy.spin`.

Before issue #290, ``hardware_estop_node.main`` wrapped ``rclpy.spin(node)``
in a bare ``try/finally`` and called plain ``rclpy.shutdown()`` in the outer
``finally`` block. On every operator Ctrl-C during ``openral deploy sim``
the finally then crashed with::

    rclpy._rclpy_pybind11.RCLError: failed to shutdown:
    rcl_shutdown already called on the given context

This is a safety-path node (Layer 6 — ROS 2 reasoner + supervisor graph spec
§5 bullet 3). The structural
contract here additionally proves that the ``except`` clause is scoped to
teardown-signal-only exceptions (``KeyboardInterrupt`` /
``ExternalShutdownException``) — it does NOT catch ``Exception``,
``ROSError``, or ``ROSSafetyViolation``, so an E-stop condition or a
safety-path failure cannot be silently swallowed at shutdown entry.

These nodes are shutdown *entry-points* for the process, not actuation
control loops, so this ``except`` cannot leave motors energised: by the time
``main()`` is exiting the hardware estop node has already published its estop
on ``/openral/estop`` and the C++ safety kernel owns the actuation
gate independently.
