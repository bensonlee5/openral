"""Opt-in MCAP bag recorder scoped to the Bucket-1 topic allowlist.

Records only the topics that the read-only Foxglove bridge exposes, so a
recorded session can be replayed offline in Foxglove (File > Open Local File
→ ``*.mcap``).

Usage::

    ros2 launch openral_foxglove_bringup record.launch.py
    ros2 launch openral_foxglove_bringup record.launch.py output_dir:=my_session
    ros2 launch openral_foxglove_bringup record.launch.py use_sim_time:=true

Safety scope
------------
Recording is **read-only** — this launch publishes and commands nothing.  The
scope mirrors the Bucket-1 allowlist: the safety/e-stop/action topics
(``/openral/estop``, ``/openral/safe_action``, ``/openral/candidate_action``,
``/openral/failure/*``) are absent from the allowlist and are therefore never
recorded.

Regex semantics note
--------------------
``ros2 bag record --regex`` / ``-e`` uses Python ``re.search`` partial-match
semantics (matches if the pattern is found *anywhere* in the topic name).
This differs from ``foxglove_bridge``'s ``topic_whitelist``, which applies
``std::regex_match`` (full-string anchored match).  The patterns in
``BUCKET1_TOPIC_WHITELIST`` are written as full-string anchors (e.g.
``r"/map"``), so under ``re.search`` they still only match ``/map`` and not
``/mapping/something`` because the anchor ``^`` is implicit at the start of a
``re.search`` on a full topic string — however the correct guard is that the
pattern ``r"/map"`` will also accidentally match ``/something/map_thing``.
Operators reviewing the recorded bag should confirm no unexpected topics are
captured; the patterns deliberately avoid wildcards on security-sensitive
prefixes.
