"""ROS 2 reasoner + supervisor graph — ``reasoner_node`` lifecycle wrapper.

Subscribes to:

* ``/openral/world_state_slow``  — ``openral_msgs/WorldStateStamped``, 5 Hz
* ``/openral/failure/{hal,sensor,rskill,safety,wam,critic}``  — ``openral_msgs/FailureTrigger``
* ``/openral/perception/{motion,objects,ocr,scene_change}``  — ``openral_msgs/PromptStamped``
* ``/openral/prompt``            — ``openral_msgs/PromptStamped`` (operator)

Heartbeat tick at ``tick_hz`` (default 0.2 Hz = one every 5 s; was 5 Hz
pre-2026-05-25 amendment to this design). The event bus is the primary
trigger: an incoming :class:`FailureTrigger` with
``severity>=SEVERITY_FAIL`` (or ``>=SEVERITY_WARN`` on
``/openral/failure/safety`` — Tier A), or a new ``/openral/prompt``
arrival, forces an out-of-band tick (subject to the
:class:`~openral_reasoner.ReasonerCore` 100 ms min-interval per
the reasoner+supervisor design §4). Heartbeat ticks that see no new event since the last
successful tick are short-circuited inside ``ReasonerCore`` with
``suppressed_reason="heartbeat_idle"``.

Dispatches the selected :data:`~openral_core.ReasonerToolCall`:

* :class:`ExecuteRskillTool` → action goal on
  ``/openral/execute_rskill`` (the F1 ``rskill_runner_node`` server).
  Streams feedback to the structlog warning channel, and emits a
  :class:`~openral_msgs.msg.FailureTrigger` on
  ``/openral/failure/rskill`` (``KIND_CONTROLLER`` for
  rejection/abort/server-unavailable; ``KIND_TIMEOUT`` when the
  ``deadline_s`` elapses before the server returns a result).
* :class:`LifecycleTransitionTool` → service call on
  ``<node>/change_state`` (``lifecycle_msgs/srv/ChangeState``). The
  ``"configure"`` / ``"activate"`` / ``"deactivate"`` / ``"cleanup"``
  strings are mapped to the matching ``Transition.TRANSITION_*``
  constants; ``"shutdown"`` is deliberately absent from the palette
  per CLAUDE.md §6 Layer 6.
* :class:`ReloadGstPipelineTool` → service call on
  ``/openral/sensors/<sensor_id>/reload_pipeline``. **Deferred** — the
  F6 sensor-package service IDL is not yet on disk; this branch logs
  a warning and acknowledges the call. Wired in a follow-up PR once
  the F6 sensor packages land.
* :class:`EmitPromptTool` → republish on the target ``PromptStamped``
  topic.

The reasoner **never** publishes ``openral_msgs/ActionChunk`` (per the
reasoner+supervisor design §4 "Holds no authority over actuation").

# skill (e.g. pi05/smolvla LIBERO with a delta-EEF representation) is
# admissible; under ``real`` only the robot's declared

# ``tests/unit/test_sim_executable_modes_match_packers.py`` (both

          place with finer children via :meth:`MissionState.subdivide_active`
          (depth-bounded). Only the active task may be subdivided; a stale /
          non-active id is logged and ignored.
        * **populate** (id empty) — replace the whole queue with a better
          decomposition of the operator goal, but only before any task has been
          attempted (:meth:`MissionState.has_started`) so a refinement never
          discards in-flight progress.

        Edits the S2 ledger only — no actuation. A forced Tier-C tick wakes the
        reasoner to act on the new active task.
