"""Single-process composer for rskill_runner + world_state.

This module locks the contract that ``WorldStateAggregator`` is the
*only* subscriber of ``/joint_states`` and bridges them in-process via
``.snapshot()`` to the rskill. That contract requires the world_state
lifecycle node and the rskill_runner_node to share **one** aggregator
instance in the same OS process so the rskill's snapshot call does not
have to cross a ROS topic boundary.

:func:`compose_runtime` is the single function the production launches
and the integration tests both call. It:

1. Loads the target robot's ``RobotDescription`` from its on-disk
   ``robot.yaml`` (CLAUDE.md §1.11 — real manifests under ``robots/``,
   never a placeholder).
2. Constructs **one** :class:`WorldStateAggregator`.
3. Hands the same instance by reference to
   :class:`_WorldStateLifecycleNode` (via its optional ``aggregator``
   constructor argument) and :class:`RskillRunnerNode` (via its
   ``aggregator`` kwarg).
4. Returns both nodes so the caller can attach them to an
   ``rclpy.executors.MultiThreadedExecutor``.

The compose factory does **not** drive lifecycle transitions; the
caller (launch file's ``runtime_node`` entry point or a test
``trigger_configure`` sequence) configures + activates after composing.

            a resolver that closes over the just-constructed

            create per-skill ActionClients on the same spin.

            :class:`~openral_runner.world_cloud_bridge.WorldCloudBridge`

            into the dashboard via the ``world.pointcloud`` OTel span
            family. Defaults to ``False`` so deployments without octomap
            don't pay the subscription cost.
        dataset_out: when set, attach a
            :class:`~openral_runner.dataset_recorder_bridge.DatasetRecorderBridge`
            that records the deploy session (proprio + action + camera
            frames + episode markers) to this rosbag2 ``.mcap`` path. The
            caller must call ``runtime.dataset_recorder_bridge.destroy()``
            on teardown to finalize the bag. ``None`` disables recording.
        dataset_repo_id: repo_id stamped into the recorded frames /
            eventual LeRobotDataset. Defaults to ``openral/dataset-<robot>``.
        dataset_license: SPDX license carried into the offline
