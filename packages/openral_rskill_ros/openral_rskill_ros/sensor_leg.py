"""Real-mode camera leg: open every deploy-bound sensor and publish to ROS.

``openral deploy run`` composes the same launch graph as ``deploy sim``,
but where the sim HAL publishes camera frames itself (``SimSensorBridge``
renders MuJoCo cameras onto ``/openral/cameras/<name>/image``), real
hardware has no camera publisher. The physical ``/dev/video*`` devices are
described by :attr:`~openral_core.SensorSpec.deploy_binding` — on the robot
manifest for robot-mounted cameras (wrist / head) and on
:attr:`~openral_core.DeployScene.sensors` for workcell-mounted ones
(overhead / front).

This module is that leg. :func:`open_deploy_sensor_readers` builds one
reader per bound spec via the runner's ``SENSOR_BACKEND_REGISTRY`` and
guarantees every camera ends up on the WorldState subscription topic
``<topic_prefix>/<name>/image``:

* ``gstreamer`` backend — the reader's built-in ROS tee publishes
  directly from the pipeline (``pipeline._build_ros_tee_branch``).
* ``opencv_thread`` (and any backend without a native tee) — the open
  reader is wrapped in a polling
  :class:`~openral_sensors.ros_publisher.SensorRosPublisher`.

Publishers use the CLAUDE.md §2 sensor-stream QoS (BEST_EFFORT); the
WorldState image subscription requests BEST_EFFORT so both match.

**Direct aggregator path (zero-copy vision path).** The reader, WorldState
aggregator, and skill runner share one OS process (``compose_runtime``), yet
frames historically took an intra-process ROS round trip (reader tee →
``sensor_msgs/Image`` → ``_on_image`` rebuilds a data-only ``SensorFrame``) —
which both re-serializes every pixel and destroys the zero-copy NVMM
``SensorFrame.handle``. When the caller passes the shared ``aggregator``,
an :class:`_AggregatorPump` per reader writes ``read_latest()`` frames
straight into ``WorldStateAggregator.update_image_frame`` — handles intact.
The ROS tee stays on for observability (dashboard thumbnails, detectors);
WorldState's ``direct_image_frame_sensors`` parameter stops ``_on_image``
from double-writing those sensors into the aggregator.

The caller owns teardown: :meth:`SensorLeg.close` stops publishers and
closes readers idempotently. ``runtime_node`` wires this in when its
``deploy_config`` parameter is set (real deploys only — sim keeps the
HAL bridge as its single camera source).
