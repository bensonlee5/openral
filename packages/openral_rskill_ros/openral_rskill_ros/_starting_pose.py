"""Pure starting-pose dispatch decision + MoveIt goal shaping.

Before the first inference tick of an ``ExecuteSkill`` goal, the runner can move
the HAL to the rSkill's in-distribution ``starting_pose`` two ways:

* **approach** — dispatch the MoveIt ``rskill-moveit-joints`` rSkill
  (``kind: ros_action``) retargeted at ``starting_pose``: MoveIt plans a
  collision-free joint-space motion (self + planning-scene/world collision) and
  ``ROSActionRskill`` replays it per-waypoint through ``/openral/candidate_action``
  (the kernel checks every step). A failure is **fatal** — the runner aborts the
  goal rather than start the policy from an unreachable / colliding state.
* **reset** — the legacy ``ResetToPose`` snap (instantaneous ``qpos`` teleport),
  **best-effort** — a failure only warns (legacy behaviour, kept for HALs
  without a MoveIt config).

This module holds only the *decision* and *pure goal-shaping* (no ROS) so it is
unit-testable. The MoveGroup dispatch itself lives in the node.
