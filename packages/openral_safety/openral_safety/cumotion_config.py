"""cuRobo robot-config emission from the lowered safety collision model.

cuMotion's planner (cuRobo) represents each link's collision volume as a set of
**spheres**, while the OpenRAL safety kernel lowers links to **capsules/spheres**.
To keep plan-time (cuMotion) and kernel-time collision geometry
consistent — a single source of truth — this module derives cuRobo collision
spheres directly from the same lowered capsule geometry, by sampling spheres
along each capsule's central segment.

Pure module: no ROS, no cuRobo import, no I/O. The only heavy dependency
(``numpy``) is pulled in lazily by the reused capsule→segment helper.
