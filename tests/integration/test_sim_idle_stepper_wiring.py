"""Integration coverage for the sim-only idle stepper's WIRED bridge+HAL path.

The 2026-06-04 idle-stepper amendment added this coverage. The unit suite
(``python/hal/tests/test_sim_attached_idle_step.py``) already covers
:meth:`SimAttachedHAL.idle_step` in isolation (frame-advance, estop-suppress,
terminal-reset, crash-containment) and the pure :func:`should_idle_step`
predicate. What was *deferred* — and is added here — is integration-level proof
that the WIRED :class:`SimSensorBridge` (against a real lifecycle node) +
:class:`SimAttachedHAL` (against a real sim env) together keep an idle scene
live and yield to an active action stream. The regression this guards is an
idle ``openral deploy sim`` scene freezing the perception bus: the env only steps
on ``/openral/safe_action`` receipt, so when no skill runs the cameras go
stale.

Test FORM — in-process real-component integration, NOT ``launch_testing``
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A ``launch_testing`` variant would bring up the lifecycle node and assert on
the idle *timer* firing on its own wall-clock cadence. That is exactly the
source of flakiness for which this test was deferred: the assertion
("cameras kept advancing while idle", "idle did not double-step under load")
hinges on the precise interleaving of the rclpy timer, the camera-publish
timer, and the ``last_action_ns`` stamp — none of which a black-box launch
test can pin deterministically. A slow CI host, a GC pause, or executor
scheduling jitter flips the result.

So this test wires the REAL components — a real ``rclpy`` ``LifecycleNode``
(the framework boundary; its ``create_timer`` / ``create_publisher`` /
``get_logger`` surface is genuine, not stubbed), a real ``SimSensorBridge``,
and a real ``SimAttachedHAL`` over a real native-MuJoCo sim env (no mocks,
CLAUDE.md §1.11) — and drives the bridge's own idle-tick callback
(``_idle_step_tick``) directly a controlled number of times rather than
waiting on the wall-clock timer. This exercises the full wiring
(bridge predicate → ``hal.idle_step`` → ``env.step`` → ``read_images``
re-cache) deterministically, with no timer-timing flakiness. Timing
tolerances are generous (a multi-second idle-hold) so the yield assertion can
never race the clock.

Backend choice: the native-MuJoCo ``so101_box`` scene (``scenes/sim/
so101_tube_insertion.yaml``) — it exercises ``SimSensorBridge`` with live
``mujoco_handles`` + rendered camera frames, builds in ~5 s, and needs neither
``libero`` nor ``robocasa`` (neither installed here), so it is the lightest
backend that drives the real idle path. We avoid the ~60 s robocasa kitchen
build entirely.
