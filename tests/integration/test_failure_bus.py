"""Integration tests for the namespaced FailureTrigger bus.

Drives the real
:class:`openral_observability.FailureBusPublisher` against the
colcon-built ``openral_msgs/msg/FailureTrigger`` IDL through ``rclpy``
and asserts:

1. Each :class:`FailureSource` publishes on its own
   ``/openral/failure/<suffix>`` topic.
2. The typed uint8 ``kind`` / ``severity`` fields are wire-correct
   against the IDL ``KIND_*`` / ``SEVERITY_*`` constants.
3. ``evidence_json`` round-trips through the Pydantic
   :data:`openral_core.FailureEvidence` discriminated union.
4. The publisher's token bucket drops excess WARN events.
5. After dropped events, a ``KIND_SUPPRESSED_SUMMARY`` roll-up appears
   at the configured cadence carrying the suppressed counts.
6. ``SEVERITY_ABORT`` is never rate-limited.

Per CLAUDE.md §1.11 / §5.4: real schemas, real IDL, real rclpy, no
mocks. The test skips with a typed reason when ROS 2 is not sourced.
