"""LIBERO scene loads via the deploy-sim HAL path; cameras + joint state real.

Resolves spec risk #1 (the robosuite ``robot0_joint*`` mapping) and the camera-key
fix (scene obs keyed ``camera1``/``camera2``, mapped to the ``front``/``wrist``
topics by ``SimSensorBridge`` at publish time) on a REAL LIBERO
SimScene. Drives raw HAL reads (no VLA) so it is GPU-independent for inference.

Environment gate: the LIBERO backend pulls ``lerobot[libero]`` → robosuite 1.4.0,
which conflicts with RoboCasa's robosuite>=1.5 — the two cannot coexist
in one venv. So this test ``importorskip``s ``libero`` and runs only on a
LIBERO-provisioned env / CI, never alongside the robocasa group.
