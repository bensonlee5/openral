"""Joint-convention guard: a HAL's published joints must obey its own kinematic limits.

The safety kernel's collision FK is built from each robot's ``robot.yaml`` joint
chain (axes + ``position_limits``, from the collision-lowering tool). If a HAL ever
published a joint
value in a DIFFERENT sign/axis convention than that model, the kernel would
forward-kinematics a configuration the real robot is not in — a mirror-image arm
— which both false-positives self-collision E-stops AND can MISS real collisions.

Such a mismatch would be detectable on any joint whose declared ``position_limits``
are entirely one sign (e.g. the Franka ``panda_joint4`` range ``[-3.0718,
-0.0698]``): a sign flip lands the published value OUTSIDE the declared range.
This module asserts the cheap, robust invariant — **every HAL-published joint
position lies within that joint's declared ``position_limits``** — so a future
convention regression trips a test instead of silently feeding the safety kernel
a wrong pose.

Status: no such mismatch exists today. A live robocasa pin (2026-06-16) read the
``panda_mobile`` ``panda_joint4`` three ways at the same configuration — raw
MuJoCo ``robot0_joint4`` qpos, robosuite ``robot0_joint_pos[3]``, and
``SimAttachedHAL.read_state`` — and all three agreed at ``-2.2384`` rad (negative,
inside ``[-3.0718, -0.0698]``). An earlier "joint4 publishes +2.6" report was a
parsing artifact in a throwaway analysis script (``str.strip('- \\n')`` ate the
leading minus sign), not a defect in OpenRAL. This guard is kept as a forward
invariant, not a bug repro. See GH #13 for the full pin.

Cross-HAL audit (2026-06-16): NO read path in ANY HAL applies a sign/axis
transform — ``SimAttachedHAL`` and ``MujocoArmHAL`` read raw ``qpos`` keyed by
joint name, and the ros2_control bridge republishes ``/joint_states`` verbatim.
So a flip cannot be *introduced* in code; the only residual risk is a per-robot
``robot.yaml``-vs-MJCF data discrepancy. Of every shipped ``robot.yaml``, only
``franka_panda`` / ``panda_mobile`` have an asymmetric (single-sign) arm joint
(``panda_joint4``) — the lone case where the range invariant can even catch a
flip; both verified consistent. The other arms have symmetric ranges (a flip
would be range-invisible) but are covered structurally by the no-transform read.

Coverage today (each commands a mid-range in-limits pose, reads it back, asserts
within limits; skips if its MJCF asset is unavailable):
* ``franka_panda`` (menagerie) — also round-trips the commanded joint4 sign.
* ``openarm`` (openarm_v2 bimanual), ``so100`` (menagerie), ``aloha`` (gym_aloha).
