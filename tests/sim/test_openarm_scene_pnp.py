"""Smoke test for the OpenArm v2 tabletop scene + robosuite OSC wiring.

Loads the scene end-to-end (real MJCF compile, real MjSim, real OSC),
resets it, runs a handful of zero-action steps, and asserts the
observation dict matches the rSkill manifest's IO contract (16-D state,
3 RGB cameras keyed top/wrist_left/wrist_right, task instruction
present). No mocks, no stubs — CLAUDE.md §1.11 / §5.4.

Skipped automatically when ``robosuite`` is not installed (CI without
the ``robocasa`` extras group).
