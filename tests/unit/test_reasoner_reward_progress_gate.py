"""Progress-gated verdict, two-head context, locate budget.

Pure-Python (no rclpy / no openral_msgs): exercises the reasoner-internal
``mission`` + ``context`` modules that the libero_object plateau fix lives in.

* the ``## REWARD`` context section renders BOTH heads, distinctly labelled, so
  the LLM uses progress for persist-vs-replan and success for done-ness;
* the per-task :class:`TaskLocateBudget` abandons the active subtask after N
  locate cycles without a skill dispatch, carrying a specific reason into the
  mission ledger so the next pick proceeds.
