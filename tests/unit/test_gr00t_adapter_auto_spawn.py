"""Unit tests for the NVIDIA GR00T-N1.7 rSkill contract (in-process backend).

GR00T-N1.7 now loads **in-process** via lerobot 0.6.0's native ``GrootPolicy``
(``openral_sim.policies.gr00t``), NF4-quantized like pi05 — there is no longer a
Python-3.10 ZMQ sidecar on the default path. The live in-process backend (load,
8 GiB NF4 fit, real action chunk) is exercised by the sim-tier
``tests/sim/test_franka_groot_libero.py`` on a GPU host.

This unit test pins only the GPU-free contract: the shipped manifest validates
and carries the right family/license posture. (The legacy sidecar behaviour
tests were removed together with ``tools/gr00t_sidecar.py`` — GR00T-N1.7 no
longer runs out-of-process; the in-process backend is gated by its 5/5
LIBERO-spatial rollout instead of a numerical parity harness.)
