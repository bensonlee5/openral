"""Repo-wide safeguard: every VLA rSkill's ``action_contract`` is executable
on each declared embodiment.

This is the regression net behind the worked sweeps
(``test_libero_action_contracts.py`` / ``test_cartesian_rskill_contracts.py``):
those assert the *specific* skills that were fixed; this walks **every**
``rskills/*/rskill.yaml`` so a *future* cartesian rSkill cannot silently ship a
bare ``action_contract.dim`` (no ``representation`` / ``slots``) that the
skill_runner would mis-dispatch as ``JOINT_POSITION`` on a non-matching robot —
the exact bug this guards against for the LIBERO class.

The check is pure ``openral_core`` (representation / slots / dim vs the robot's
joints + a sim-executable control-mode set). It deliberately does **not** import
``openral_reasoner_ros.reasoner_node`` (that pulls rclpy + openral_msgs); the
small gate rule is re-derived here so the validator runs under a bare
``uv run --no-sync`` without a ROS environment. It mirrors
``reasoner_node._required_control_modes`` and uses the canonical
``openral_core.SIM_EXECUTABLE_CONTROL_MODES`` (amended 2026-06-04 —
single source of truth shared by the reasoner gate and the HAL packers, so this
validator can no longer drift from what the deploy-sim path actually executes).

The per-(skill, robot) rule, in order of contract specificity:

* ``action_contract is None`` → no action constraint → pass.
* ``representation`` set → ``control_modes_for_representation(representation)``;
  additionally ``canonical_slots_for_representation`` must resolve without error
  against the robot (proves the cartesian/gripper layout binds to a real
  end-effector and the dim is wide enough).
* ``slots`` set → ``{s.control_mode for s in slots if s.control_mode}`` (the
  ActionSlot cross-validator already proved coverage + per-mode fields at load).
* Bare ``dim`` only → implicitly joint-space (``{JOINT_POSITION}``); additionally
  ``dim`` must equal the robot's actuated-joint count. A mismatch means a
  cartesian (or otherwise non-joint) skill is under-declared — it would default
  the whole vector to ``JOINT_POSITION`` and trip the joint-space envelope. The
  one principled relaxation: robots with actuated *dexterous hands* carry
  actuated DoF (finger joints) that ``robots/<id>/robot.yaml`` does not enumerate
  in ``joints``, so the strict equality becomes ``dim >= len(joints)`` for them
  (still rejects a too-small / cartesian-masquerading vector).

For declared (representation / slots) contracts the required modes must also be
a subset of the deploy-sim-executable set
``openral_core.SIM_EXECUTABLE_CONTROL_MODES`` ({JOINT_POSITION, JOINT_VELOCITY,
CARTESIAN_DELTA, GRIPPER_POSITION, BODY_TWIST, COMPOSITE_MODE}) — i.e. the
deploy-sim OSC / composite path can actually pack and execute them. Real-mode
executability against a specific robot's ``supported_control_modes`` is the
reasoner gate's runtime job; this test guards declaration sanity,
sim-executability, and the bare-dim==joints invariant.
