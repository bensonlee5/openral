"""Regression test — every ``robots/<id>/robot.yaml`` matches its in-code
``*_DESCRIPTION`` HAL constant, where one exists.

The HAL constants in ``python/hal/src/openral_hal/`` are the runtime
source of truth; the YAMLs under ``robots/`` are what the eval layer loads
via ``ROBOTS.register``. This test pins them together so a future bump to
joint limits / payload / safety envelope can't silently drift the YAML out
of sync with the HAL.

Coverage
--------
- ``robots/ur5e/robot.yaml``           ↔ ``UR5e_REAL_DESCRIPTION``      (HAL `ur_real.py`)
- ``robots/ur10e/robot.yaml``          ↔ ``UR10e_REAL_DESCRIPTION``     (HAL `ur_real.py`)
- ``robots/franka_panda/robot.yaml``   ↔ ``FRANKA_PANDA_REAL_DESCRIPTION``
- ``robots/sawyer/robot.yaml``         ↔ ``SAWYER_REAL_DESCRIPTION``
- ``robots/aloha_bimanual/robot.yaml`` ↔ ``ALOHA_REAL_DESCRIPTION``
- ``robots/g1/robot.yaml``             ↔ ``G1_DESCRIPTION``             (HAL `g1.py`)
- ``robots/h1/robot.yaml``             ↔ ``H1_DESCRIPTION``             (HAL `h1.py`)
- ``robots/rizon4/robot.yaml``         ↔ ``RIZON4_DESCRIPTION``         (HAL `flexiv_rizon4.py`)
- ``robots/openarm/robot.yaml``        ↔ ``OPENARM_DESCRIPTION``        (HAL `openarm.py`)
- ``robots/anvil_openarm_v2/robot.yaml`` ↔ ``ANVIL_OPENARM_V2_DESCRIPTION``

Most covered YAMLs pin to the **real-hardware** ``*_REAL_DESCRIPTION``
constant because those YAMLs are the production-deployment manifests.
The Franka / Sawyer / ALOHA real descriptions are derived from their sim
baselines (``FRANKA_PANDA_DESCRIPTION`` / ``SAWYER_DESCRIPTION`` /
``ALOHA_DESCRIPTION``) via
:func:`openral_hal._real_description.make_real_description`. The UR
real descriptions (``UR5e_REAL_DESCRIPTION`` / ``UR10e_REAL_DESCRIPTION``
in ``ur_real.py``) follow the same pattern, derived from
``UR5e_DESCRIPTION`` / ``UR10e_DESCRIPTION`` in ``ur.py``. In every case
kinematics + safety envelope + capabilities + ``hal`` entrypoints are shared
between the sim baseline and the real-HW description; only ``sdk_kind``
differs. The sim baselines stay in-tree as the manifest the MuJoCo /
gym sim adapter loads when available. Issues #54–#58.

The G1, H1, Rizon 4, and OpenArm all pin to their sim baselines
(``G1_DESCRIPTION`` / ``H1_DESCRIPTION`` / ``RIZON4_DESCRIPTION`` /
``OPENARM_DESCRIPTION``) because none of them have a real-HW HAL yet:
the G1 / H1 wait on the M2 C++ S0 cerebellum (CLAUDE.md §6.2); the
Rizon 4 real-HW wrapper around ``flexiv_rdk`` and the OpenArm real-HW
wrapper around lerobot's upstream driver are tracked as follow-ups.
All four YAMLs' ``hal.sim`` points at the sim HAL and ``hal.real`` is null
until the real adapter lands.

The SO-100 manifest is skipped here because its YAML carries optional
sensor entries that the in-code constant deliberately omits (the HAL
constant is only the kinematic core; sensor wiring is opt-in via
``so100_with_sensors``).  The ALOHA YAML similarly carries a top-down
camera ``SensorSpec`` and an ``observation_spec`` / ``action_spec`` block
the in-code constant omits (sensor / sim-IO wiring is owned by the eval
adapter); only the joint inventory + capability + safety + sdk pointer
is asserted equal.  ``pusht_2d`` is a sim-pseudo manifest with no in-code
DESCRIPTION sibling and is therefore not in scope for this guard.
