"""Real-component tests for ``openral install`` and the interactive REPL.

These tests exercise the actual ``openral_cli.install`` Typer app and the
REPL dispatcher in ``openral_cli.main`` — no mocks, no smoke-only
assertions (CLAUDE.md §1.11 / §5.4).

The pure-Python pieces (group enumeration, conflict detection, REPL line
dispatch) run unconditionally.  The piece that would actually shell out
to ``uv pip install`` (``install sim``) is gated behind a ``--force``-less
conflict-only probe — we never trigger a real network install in the
unit tier; that is the integration tier's job (see
``tests/integration/test_installer_curl_bash.py`` when it ships).
