"""Continuous-leg observability for the ROS-Image object detector (issue #12).

The continuous detect+publish leg in ``ros_image_detector_node`` used to swallow
its per-frame outcome silently: a ``detect()`` exception was logged at DEBUG
(invisible at the default level) and an empty result was dropped with no trace.
On ``/openral/perception/objects`` that makes a *crashing* detector (e.g. a CUDA
OOM under VLA co-residency on an 8 GB card) indistinguishable from one watching a
quiet scene — both leave the topic empty, because the real detector publishes
nothing when it sees nothing (the empty-topic-means-quiet-scene contract the
world-state eviction relies on). :func:`classify_continuous_tick` is the pure
decision that maps each tick's outcome to the log level that surfaces it, so
the leg is observable without changing what lands on the bus. Validated here
with no LifecycleNode or
executor — the node applies its own throttling and does the publish.

``openral_perception_ros`` is a colcon-built ROS package (ament_cmake); like the
other ROS-package unit tests (``test_image_convert``), skip cleanly when the
workspace overlay isn't sourced. The ros2-test CI job sources
``install/setup.bash`` and runs this for real; ``classify_continuous_tick`` is
pure Python so the guard is only about the package being importable.
