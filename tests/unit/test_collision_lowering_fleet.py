"""Fleet drift guard: every manifest with a collision model matches the tool.

`openral collision lower` owns each robot's `collision_geometry` /
`allowed_collision_pairs`; this asserts the committed manifests have not drifted
from what the tool would regenerate. Replaces the single hand-pinned
panda test with a parametrized fleet check. Real manifests, no mocks (§1.11);
robots whose URDF/SRDF is unavailable on this host SKIP rather than fake.

Gated on the `[lowering]` group (yourdfpy). On CI runners without it, the whole
module skips — the guard runs on dev hosts and the lowering CI lane.
