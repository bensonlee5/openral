"""Unit tests for :func:`openral_reasoner.render_robot_context_prompt`.

Option B (ADR-0018 F4): the reasoner's system prompt carries a
``## THIS ROBOT`` block built from the active robot's
:class:`~openral_core.RobotCapabilities`. We validate against real
``robots/`` fixtures (CLAUDE.md §1.11) — ``panda_mobile`` (a wheeled
mobile manipulator) and ``so100_follower`` (a fixed-base arm) — to
exercise both locomotion branches with real capability data, never
``"foo"`` placeholders.
