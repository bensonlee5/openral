"""Regression guard for the active-search cascade bound.

The find→re-prompt cascade (recall_object → escalate locate_in_view → re-prompt)
is bounded by ``SearchProgress``: after ``max_attempts`` consecutive lookups the
reasoner hands off to a human instead of looping forever. The bound counts only
*consecutive search* dispatches — a non-search tool call resets the streak.

The bug this guards: ``locate_in_view`` was **not** in the exempt set, so a
directly-emitted ``LocateInViewTool`` reset the very budget meant to bound it.
Against an object the detector can't recognise (``found=False`` every time), the
``recall → locate → recall`` loop zeroed the counter each cycle and never handed
off — observed live as 127 consecutive locate attempts with the VLA never
dispatched (libero_object deploy scene).
