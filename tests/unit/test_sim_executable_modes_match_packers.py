"""Lockstep proof: ``SIM_EXECUTABLE_CONTROL_MODES`` == the sim HAL packers.

Amended 2026-06-04. The reasoner's ``hal_mode="sim"`` palette
gate admits a VLA rSkill only when every :class:`ControlMode` its action
contract demands is in :data:`openral_core.SIM_EXECUTABLE_CONTROL_MODES`.
That constant is only safe if it is *exactly* the set of modes the default
sim HAL action-packers can execute — admit a mode no packer implements and
the skill boots fine, then E-stops mid-run when the first chunk of that
mode hits a packer ``else`` branch.

This test pins the two sides together, **both directions**, against the
REAL packers in :mod:`openral_hal.sim_attached` (CLAUDE.md §1.11 — no
mocks; pure-numpy packers driven with real :class:`Action` chunks and real
:class:`RobotDescription` manifests loaded from ``robots/``):

* :func:`pack_action_for_env` — the default free-function packer.
* :meth:`SimAttachedHAL._pack_with_composite_split` — the robosuite
  composite-slot packer.
* The ``BODY_TWIST`` direct-qpos path intercepted in
  :meth:`SimAttachedHAL.send_action` (NOT a packer ``else`` branch — see
  the BODY_TWIST note below).

A mode is classified **handled** by a packer when driving a representative
chunk of that mode does *not* raise the packer's unsupported-mode
``ROSConfigError`` (the one carrying ``"unsupported control_mode"``). A
*different* ``ROSConfigError`` (e.g. "composite has no 'right' part" when
no live env is bound) still means the mode *reached its own branch* — i.e.
the packer knows how to execute it — so it counts as handled. Only the
closing ``else`` (``"unsupported control_mode"``) marks a mode as
**rejected**.

To make the discrimination clean, every representative chunk also carries a
``joint_targets`` row: ``pack_action_for_env`` guards ``not joint_targets``
*before* the closing ``else``, so without a row an unsupported mode would
raise the empty-payload guard rather than the unsupported-mode ``else``.
Populating both fields lets every unsupported mode fall through to the real
``else``.

The union of the two packers' handled sets must equal
``SIM_EXECUTABLE_CONTROL_MODES`` exactly. The four latent false-admits
removed by this amendment (JOINT_TORQUE, JOINT_TRAJECTORY, CARTESIAN_POSE,
GRIPPER_BINARY) and the three never-admitted modes (CARTESIAN_TWIST,
FOOT_PLACEMENT, DEX_HAND_JOINT) must be rejected by BOTH packers AND absent
from the constant.
