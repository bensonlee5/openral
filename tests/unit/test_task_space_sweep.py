"""Repo-wide TaskSpace compliance sweep.

Verifies that **every** shipped robot and rSkill complies with the schema, and
pins the cross-layer task-space compatibility of every actuating skill against
every robot it claims (by ``embodiment_tags``). Real fixtures only — no mocks
(CLAUDE.md §1.11).

Three kinds of compliance are distinguished:

* **Structural** — the manifest loads and validates against the Pydantic schema
  (`RobotDescription` / `RSkillManifest`). Enforced at definition time today.
  Every robot and rSkill must pass (`test_all_*_load`).
* **Cross-layer (rSkill × robot)** — the skill's `TaskSpace` is executable on the
  robot. Checked in `hal_mode="sim"` (the path everything we ship actually runs
  on). All pairs pass except the recorded `KNOWN_SIM_GAPS` (rlbench cartesian-pose
  + gr1 29-DoF — both dedicated-controller paths, not the default packers). The
  test asserts the gap set exactly, so a fix that isn't recorded here (or a new
  regression) trips it.
* **Scene leg (rSkill × scene)** — Phase 4. For each scene family an
  rSkill is `evaluated_tasks`-on, the skill's `TaskSpace` modes (and fixed dim)
  must be executable by that family's declared `SceneTaskSpace`. `KNOWN_SCENE_GAPS`
  is empty; every declared family must have an entry in `SCENE_FAMILY_TASK_SPACE`.

# longer cross-layer *bugs* — both remaining entries run sim through a dedicated
# controller path, not the default packers, so their control mode is correctly
# outside the default-packer set (same category as any sidecar skill):
#
#   * 3d-diffuser-actor-rlbench emits absolute CARTESIAN_POSE (pos+quat) consumed
#     by the RLBench / CoppeliaSim (PyRep) sidecar — never the SimAttachedHAL
#     packers. (Its gripper-slot EE name was fixed: panda_gripper -> panda_hand.)
#   * rldx1-ft-gr1-nf4 emits a 29-D GR1 whole-body action (3 waist + 7+7 arms +
#     6+6 Fourier-hand finger DoF). The robot enumerates 17 joints; the 12 hand
#     DoF are EE-owned (the two dexterous-hand EEs, n_dof=6 each) by deliberate
#     design, NOT joints. So the bare-dim contract's single 29-wide joint segment
#     exceeds the 17 enumerated joints. It runs via the robosuite BASIC composite
#     controller (gr1_unified wrapper), not the default packers. Full DOF-aware
#     accounting (counting EE-owned hand DoF toward the joint budget) is a
#     follow-up; the empty-modes bug on the gr1 robot IS fixed here.
