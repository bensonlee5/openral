"""Invariant: an rskill claiming ``joint_position``-only actuators must not
emit more action dimensions than its target robot has declared joints.

Before this invariant was enforced at fixture load, the only way the runner
could discover that a checkpoint's action vector exceeded the robot's joint
count was at *runtime* — the safety supervisor's ``n_dof`` envelope check
would fire, the HAL would E-stop, and the reasoner would spin in retry loops.

This test pins the invariant at fixture load. For every
``rskills/*/rskill.yaml``:

* If the manifest declares ``actuators_required`` of pure
  ``ControlMode.JOINT_POSITION`` AND either no
  ``action_contract.representation`` or
  ``ActionRepresentation.JOINT_POSITIONS``: the manifest is *claiming*
  the action vector is straight joint targets.
* Then for every ``embodiment_tag`` that resolves to a registered
  ``RobotDescription`` (i.e. the tag is also a robot name under
  ``robots/``): ``action_contract.dim <= len(robot.joints)``.

``dim < len(joints)`` is permitted (the checkpoint doesn't command the
trailing joints — e.g. a LIBERO 7-D action on a Franka with a declared
gripper joint; the gripper stays put). ``dim > len(joints)`` is the
failure case — the action vector contains channels that aren't joints
(RoboCasa pi0.5 / rldx1's [arm_osc(6) + gripper(2) + base(3) + torso(1)]
layout, GR-1's full-body joints + hand fingers). Those rskills must
either honestly declare a non-joint ``representation`` or — once the
per-slot action-contract support lands — carry an ``action_contract.slots``
block describing the layout. Until then, they are tracked here as
``xfail`` with a pointer to the follow-up.
