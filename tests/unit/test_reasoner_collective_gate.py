"""Unit slice for the collective-target detector.

A skill acts on exactly ONE specific object, so the reasoner refuses to actuate
while the active task targets a collective/quantified set ("put ALL the objects
in the basket") and self-prompts the LLM to enumerate (scene_objects is already
in its context) + decompose into one subtask per object. ``is_collective_target``
is the single source of truth (``openral_core``) shared by the ``GroundedSubtask``
schema validator and the reasoner node's runtime execute gate. Pure helper — no
ROS — so this pins it directly; the full block→invite→decompose flow is exercised
by the deploy-sim run.
