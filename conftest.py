"""Repo-root pytest conftest — runs for every pytest invocation under this repo.

Discovered by pytest because ``pyproject.toml`` lives in this directory, so
this conftest is loaded for both the standard ``pytest tests/...`` runs and
for the ``pytest --doctest-modules python/...`` subprocess that
:mod:`tests.unit.test_doctest_runner` spawns.

Responsibilities
----------------
- **Silence structlog logging during tests.**  Several public modules emit
  ``log.info(...)`` from constructors / ``connect()`` / ``disconnect()``
  (e.g. :class:`openral_world_state.WorldStateAggregator`,
  :class:`openral_hal.RosControlHAL`,
  :class:`openral_hal.SO100FollowerHAL`).  structlog's default
  ``PrintLoggerFactory`` writes those records to *stdout*, which breaks
  doctest matching for any docstring example that constructs one of these
  objects.  Production deployments configure structlog with an OTel handler
  per CLAUDE.md §5.1; tests deserve the same explicit configuration so that
  test stdout reflects only the test's own assertions.

This conftest is intentionally narrow — Rich console neutering still lives
in ``tests/conftest.py`` because it only matters when running tests under
``tests/``.
