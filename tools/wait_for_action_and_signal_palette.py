"""Wait for a ROS 2 action server to appear, then fire skill_registry_changed.

This is a follow-up fix for skill-palette re-seeding. Background:

The reasoner_node seeds its rSkill palette at ``on_configure``, which
runs as part of the early launch autostart (a few seconds after
``ros2 launch``). Wrapped-ROS rSkills (``kind: ros_action`` /
``ros_service``) include a graph-availability filter that drops a
skill whose ``interface_name`` is not yet advertised on the ROS
graph — preventing the reasoner from dispatching a goal to a server
that hasn't fully come up. The check is correct in spirit but
unfortunately too eager for Nav2: Nav2's lifecycle dance takes
15-30 s, so ``/navigate_to_pose`` only becomes available LONG
after the reasoner has built (and frozen) its palette.

The reasoner already supports re-seeding the palette: an ``Empty``
message on ``/openral/skill_registry_changed`` triggers
``_maybe_seed_palette_from_search_paths`` to run again. This script
is the producer: it polls
``rclpy.node.Node.get_action_names_and_types()`` until the target
action name appears, then publishes the Empty trigger. After signal
emission the script exits 0 so the launch tree doesn't carry an
orphan process.

Usage::

    python3 wait_for_action_and_signal_palette.py \\
        --action /navigate_to_pose \\
        --timeout-s 60.0

Exits non-zero only when the action never appeared within the
timeout — that's a real configuration failure (Nav2 didn't start,
network partitioned, …) and worth surfacing as an error. Times out
silently with exit 0 otherwise.
